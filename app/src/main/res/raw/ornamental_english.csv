<p><em>Alstroemeria</em> cvs. hybrids. In the last twenty years, the flowers of various commercial hybrids of species of the genus <em>Alstroemeria</em>, variously called Alstroemeria, Peruvian Lily, or Lily of the Incas, have become an increasingly important part of the commercial cut flower trade. The flowers come in a variety of types and colors. All have a long postharvest life, typically terminated by petal wilting and/or drop and yellowing of the leaves. The Swedish Consul in Spain, Kias Alstroemer, had seeds of this species brought to Europe in 1754. The famous plant taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, a friend of Alstroemer, subsequently named the species after him.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span><br /><p>*file86292*</p><p>*file86294*</p><p>*file86295*</p><br />For long-distance markets, flowers are harvested when the buds are about to open and start to color. For local market, harvest is delayed until the first 3 flowers have opened. Flowers are pulled off or cut, depending on the variety. Where pulling may damage the underground parts of the plant (as in young plants of &lsquo;Regina&rsquo;), the stem should be cut. If flowers are cut, the remaining stem should be removed later. At least one flower per stem should be open at time of purchase. Purchase only by cultivar name.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no official grade standards for alstroemeria, but in addition to the common characters of freedom from damage, and stem length, strength and straightness, it is suggested that the flowers in a bunch should be uniform. The flower head should be symmetrical, and the leaves should be bright green. The minimum acceptable number of florets per stem varies with cultivar but is typically 7 to 10.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Alstroemeria flowers are ethylene sensitive.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Although untreated alstroemeria flowers have a long vase life; petal drop (particularly a problem if there is ethylene in the environment) can be delayed by pretreatment with 1-MCP or STS. In some cultivars, leaf yellowing occurs before flower senescence. It can be delayed by a pulse treatment with a preservative containing growth regulators (gibberellins or cytokinins).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Alstroemeria should be stored at 0-1&deg;C; present information suggests that alstroemeria can readily be stored for up to 1 week at 1&deg;C.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Alstroemeria are normally bunched in 10&rsquo;s, sleeved, and packed in horizontal boxes. The flower pedicels are affected by gravity and will bend upwards when temperature control during storage is poor.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>When re-cutting, remove the whitish or blanched bottom portion of the stem, if present, for maximum solution uptake and life. Leaf removal will reduce vase life if enough flowers are not present for solution uptake. Since Alstroemeria is a member of the Amaryllidaceae, botanical families from which many pharmaceutical products are derived; it&rsquo;s not surprising that some humans get allergic dermatitis from this species.<br /><br />Source: Perishables Handling #92, November 1997</p>",alstroemeria

<p><em>Anemone </em>spp. Brightly colored in deep reds, blues, purples, and white, anemones have rather short stems, and are typically a spring flower.

Anemone is an ancient Greek name meaning windflower from 'anemos' for wind.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Anemone&rsquo;s prominence and beauty in arrangements is a double-edged sword because of the flower&rsquo;s relatively short vase life. It is preferable not to use anemones as focal points. Keep stems wrapped during re-hydration to help keep them straight. There is no scientific basis for the practice of piercing a hole through the flower base to extend life. Placing anemones in vases with freshly cut daffodils can reduce their life because of the harmful juices exuded from the daffodils.</p>

<span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span>
<p>Although there are no formal grade standards for anthuriums, top quality implies long stems, uniformity of color and size, proper maturity, glossiness of the spathe, and freedom from any damage or disease. Anthuriums are normally packed individually.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Anthuriums are not affected by exposure to ethylene, and anti-ethylene treatments provide no benefit.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Some researchers recommend pretreatment to increase the vase life of anthuriums, but some cultivars (e.g. 'Osaki') achieve maximum vase life with DI alone. It seems probable that vase life problems are associated with bacterial contamination of the cut stem bases. If anthuriums are placed in water after harvest, a biocide (e.g. 50 ppm hypochlorite) should be added. Either: Pulse the re-cut stems for 10 to 20 minutes in 1000 ppm silver nitrate. (Rinse the stems with fresh water after the treatment). Or: Dip the whole flower in an emulsion of Carnuba wax. One suitable product is FMC Wax 819. Use a 3% dilution of the wax. After dipping, place the flower stems in water while the wax dries<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Anthuriums should be stored at 12.5-20&deg;C because they are very sensitive to ""chilling"" injury. Holding the flowers for any length of time at temperatures below 10&ordm;C will induce purpling, then browning, and death of the flowers. Anthuriums should therefore never be pre-cooled with other flowers, nor held in low temperature cool-rooms. Anthuriums shipped in mixed loads at low temperatures should be protected from chilling exposure by appropriate insulation (for example wrapping the flowers in newsprint and packing them in an insulated box). Anthurium flowers can be stored for at least one week if packed in moist shredded newsprint and held at 15&deg;C. They also respond favorably to storage in controlled atmosphere. Vase life after storage was increased by 50% when flowers were stored at 12.5&deg;C in 2% oxygen for up to 2 weeks.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Anthuriums are commonly packed in moist shredded newsprint or other shredded paper. Major damage during transportation is the result of spadices puncturing the spathe of neighboring flowers in the pack. Many producers now sheathe the flowers in small plastic bags and pack the anthuriums more densely in the box.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Anthuriums can have a vase life of up to 3 weeks if properly treated. Even after storage, vase life can be adequate if proper techniques are used to handle the flowers. They are very susceptible to stem blockage and easily bruised because of mechanically induced injuries, especially during packing and unpacking. Keep holding solutions clean by using an effective preservative solution.<br /><br />Perishables Handling #92, November 1997</p>

<p><em>Asparagus</em> spp. Asparagus fern (<em>A. setaceus</em> and other species in the genus Asparagus) are probably better known in the floral trade as A. plumosus or plumosus fern, and provide an interesting foliage and filler for arrangements. These species are not true ferns but are members of the lily family, in the same genus as edible asparagus. Asparagus densiflorus ""Sprengeri"" group is another common filler foliage.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>As with other foliage, asparagus fern should be harvested when the fronds are fully mature, immature tips are very likely to wilt after harvest. Make sure that the fronds are mature, uniformly green, there are no yellow leaves, and that leaves do not fall from the fronds when they are shaken.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no formal grade standards for asparagus fern, but fronds should be intact, of uniform length, maturity, and color. Fronds are frequently bunched in groups of 20, and not normally placed in sleeves.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Exposure to ethylene will cause leaf fall in some species of asparagus fern, and therefore pretreatment with 1-MCP or STS is beneficial.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Because ethylene exposure will cause accelerated leaf fall, treatment with 1-MCP or STS is recommended.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Store asparagus ferns at 0-1&deg;C, wrapped in polyethylene to reduce drying out during storage. The fern should be cooled before being wrapped in polythene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Because of their relatively low value, asparagus and other ferns are packed densely in boxes, usually horizontal boxes that are filled as full as possible. This places an additional emphasis on the importance of pre-cooling, but no paper or plastic is used, which permits reasonably effective forced air-cooling.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Asparagus fern suffers from premature leaf fall. Induced primarily by water stress, it can be a serious problem. To avoid yellowing and leaf fall, avoid prolonged storage. Certain preservative solutions aggravate premature leaf yellowing. However, preservative solution should be used in all arrangements containing this fern, as the other floral items in the arrangement will benefit.</p>

Another important aster for florists is the China aster, <em>Callistephus chinensis</em>.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>As with most members of the Asteraceae, immature flowers (ones harvested too early) will generally not open properly. Purchase as you would purchase chrysanthemums, more open (at least three-quarters open) than in a bud stage. Avoid specimens with yellowing leaves&rsquo; as this is an indication of improper storage and/or growing conditions.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no grade standards as such, apart from the standard quality attributes of stem length, foliage quality, uniformity, and freedom from defects. Depending on the species and cultivar, bunches may be prepared by stem number (China aster, for example) or by bunch size (&lsquo;Monte Casino&rsquo; aster, for example).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Members of the Asteraceae are generally unaffected by exposure to moderate concentrations of ethylene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Poor water relations often limit the vase-life of asters. This can be demonstrated by wilting of the flower and/or buds. Their vase life has been shown to be extended by a 10-second pretreatment with high concentrations (1000 ppm) of silver nitrate, which is a very effective germicide.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Store asters at 0-1&deg;C.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Asters are packed in traditional flower boxes, hampers, or Proconas.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>It is very difficult to make broad flower care recommendations for asters because of the large number of species and cultivars. Keep stems and vase solution clean. It is especially important with asters to remove leaves that might be in the water since bacteria grow quickly on leaves that are under water, contaminating the vase solution and leading to early wilting. Treat with a hydrating solution and prepare the preservative solution properly to minimize contamination by debris and microorganisms.</p>

<p><em>Gypsophila paniculata</em>. A favorite for use in bouquets and dried flower arrangements, gypsophila is most often field grown. The flowers are sensitive to water deficit and intense sunlight, and will brown and shrivel easily if subjected to these stress conditions. On the other hand, damp or rainy conditions increase the risk of gray mold (Botrytis) and Phytophthora root rot. Gypsophila is Greek for &lsquo;gypsum-loving&rsquo; in reference to this species&rsquo; good growth performance in high calcium soils.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Gypsophila plants produce flowers on large panicles whose individual flowers open over a considerable time period. Flowering stems are usually cut 20&ndash;40 cm long. The degree of maturity at harvest is determined by whether the flowers are intended for the fresh market or for dried arrangements. Stems are cut when 50% of the flowers are open if they are to be placed in a drying solution immediately or marketed within 24 hours. Stems are cut when 20 to 30% of the flowers are open if they are to be dried later or held longer than 24 hours. Purchase gypsophila that has plenty of unopened buds, shows no signs of water stress, wilting, or disease (brown florets).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Stems are gathered into field bunches using rubber bands or ties to secure the cut ends. Bunches from California are sold as bunches with 5 to 25 stems whereas gypsophila from South America comes in bunches weighing 300 grams.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Exposure to ethylene causes wilting of open flowers and sleepiness of opening buds.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Gypsophila responds best to pretreatment with STS, which protects not only the open florets but also the developing buds. Gypsophila flowers treated with STS and held in a solution containing Physan&reg; will maintain excellent display life for several weeks, as new buds open on the panicle. However, STS sometimes offers little benefit because stem blockage prevents uptake. Make sure the stems are rinsed and re-cut underwater prior to placement in STS.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Store at 0-1&deg;C in high (90%) relative humidity to reduce flower and stem desiccation. Because Botrytis can be a serious problem, florists should ask suppliers&mdash;or be prepared themselves &mdash; to treat with appropriate fungicides. Stems with about 50% of their flowers open can be kept in a preservative solution (200 ppm Physan) at 1&deg;C for up to 3 weeks.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Gypsophila may be packed in horizontal boxes or hampers. Thirty bunches are packed in a standard box.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Gypsophila harvested in the bud stage (5% of flowers open) can be opened to excellent quality in a bud-opening solution containing 200 ppm Physan-20 and 5 to 10% sucrose. Flowers should be held at about 20&deg;C, 50% R.H., and with light levels of about 15 mmol.m-2.sec-1 PAR (use cool-white fluorescent lamps). For drying gypsophila, a solution containing 1 part glycerine to 2 parts water should be used. Cut stems are then dried by hanging bunches upside down in a warm dry environment.</p>

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Description</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Strelitzia reginae.</em> The bird of paradise inflorescence consists of a boat-shaped bract containing a series of 4 or 5 flowers, so when an exposed flower withers, another one can be pulled out. Few cut flowers have this capability. Traditionally, Southern California growers bag the inflorescence a few weeks before harvest. Slender, elongated waxed paper bags are placed over the expanding bracts a week or more before the orange flowers are ready to emerge. The bags protect the brittle flowers by holding them inside or next to the bracts. The bag also helps prevent Botrytis mold, rain and hail damage, aphid attacks, and sunburn of the flowers. The specific epithet reginae means &ldquo;queen&rdquo;.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Inflorescences bend as they reach maturity, assuming a 90&deg; angle to the stem. The first emerging orange flowers can barely be seen through the paper bags. The stems are pulled at this point. Stems can also be harvested in the tight bud stage before the first flowers emerge. At this stage the inflorescence is swollen, and there is a slight orange crack on the upper surface. The inflorescence is mature at the tight bud stage, and is at the optimum stage for harvest in regards to ease of handling and flower longevity. Flower stems are generally pulled off rather than cut. A side to side pulling motion is often necessary to loosen the stem at the base of the plant, although the inflorescences can break off if jerked too vigorously. Make sure flower heads are dry at time of purchase. If flowers are wet or have excessive nectar exudation upon unpacking then the possibility of subsequent postharvest disease problems is increased.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Strelitzia stems are sorted into at least 3 grades according to stem length and inflorescence size. For premium grade flowers, the field bags are replaced with new bags. Five stems are firmly tied together at 2 points with the inflorescences facing in the same direction. The stem ends are evenly trimmed. A paper wrapper is placed around the bunched inflorescences to further protect the flowers.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Strelitzia flowers are insensitive to ethylene and their life is not improved by treatment with STS or 1-MCP.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Flower longevity can be substantially increased by pulsing buds or flowers for 24 hours (48 hours is even better) with a solution containing 10% sucrose, 250 ppm 8-hydroxyquinoline citrate (8-HQC), and 150 ppm citric acid.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>The optimum long term storage temperature range for this species is 6-7&deg;C, which is different from most other flowers. Storage below this recommended range could result in chill disorders, the appearance of brown lesions on the flowers and bracts, and the failure of the flower to open properly. For short-term storage, hold the flowers at room temperature, or in a tropical storage room (12.5&deg;C). Strelitzia flowers harvested in the tight bud stage will open and have satisfactory vase life after 4 weeks in storage if pre-treated with a fungicide, wrapped to prevent desiccation, and stored at 7&deg;C and 85-90% R.H.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>The waxed paper bags on each inflorescence and the paper wrapper on each bunch give ample protection from handling injury and desiccation. Because they are very heavy, Strelitzia stems should be packed in shallow cartons<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>If flowers fail to emerge from the spathe (the modified leaf below the flowers), the first flower can be gently eased out by hand and will normally provide good display life.</p>

<p><em>Bouvardia</em> spp. Bouvardia flowers are a relatively recent addition to the florist&rsquo;s palette. Their bright salmon, red, and white color range and interesting flower form offer interesting design possibilities. The genus is named after Charles Bouvard, 1572-1658, who was physician to Louis XIII and superintendent of the Royal Gardens in Paris.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Bouvardia flowers are normally harvested with two to three outer flowers open. Purchase when one or two flowers are open on each stem. Avoid flowers that have yellowed foliage, or are showing signs of wilting. If the flowers have been pretreated to prevent the effects of ethylene, there should be little shattering when the flower bunch is shaken.</p>

</div>
<p>There are no formal grade standards for Bouvardia, but top quality flowers will be uniform in maturity and color, free of defects, and have good quality foliage and long stems. Flowers are normally bunched with 10 stems and sleeved prior to packing.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Accelerated wilting and abscission result from exposure of Bouvardia flowers to ethylene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Because of their ethylene sensitivity, Bouvardia flowers should be pre-treated with 1-MCP or STS. Research has shown STS to be the superior pre-treatment because it protects not only the open flowers but also the developing buds from the effects of ethylene. Treatment for 4 to 24 hours, with water containing detergents such as Agral LN or Nonoxynol-8.5 prior to dry storage prevents early wilting of the flowers.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Although previous recommendations have been to store Bouvardia at 7-10&deg;F, this species is not chilling sensitive, and therefore should be stored, like most temperate cut flowers, at 0-1&deg;C.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Bouvardia may be packed in horizontal boxes or Proconas.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Bouvardia exhibits leaf yellowing and is wilt sensitive. In some markets a special preservative formulation is sold that can reduce leaf yellowing. Re-cut stems underwater and use good sanitation procedures to reduce the frequency of wilted flowers. Postharvest performance differs greatly among the many cultivars marketed.</p>

<p><em>Zantedeschia</em> spp. The striking white blooms of <em>Zantedeschia aethiopica</em> have long been an important cut flower, and new green-tinged and different-shaped variants are increasingly important. The hybrid &lsquo;mini-callas&rsquo;, with their elegant shape and wide range of colors, continue to increase in importance as cut flowers and potted plants. The showy &lsquo;spathe&rsquo; is a leaf-like organ that surrounds the true flowers, the thick, fleshy &lsquo;spadix&rsquo;. The genus is named for Francesco Zantedeschia who wrote about Italian plants around 1825. Although often called calla lilies, these flowers are not related to the true lily.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Callas should be harvested when the spathe has opened enough so that the spadix can be seen. Flowers harvested more mature will be more susceptible to damage, and may have reduced vase life. The flowers are normally pulled from the rhizome, and re-cut to ensure adequate water uptake. The spadix (the thick fleshy inflorescence inside the showy spathe) should be visible at the time of purchase. Watch for bruising of the fleshy stems due to packaging. If cut too tight, flowers will usually not open properly.</p>

</div>
<p>Both standard and miniature carnations are graded by stem strength, stem length, bloom diameter, and freedom from defects. Stem strength is determined by holding the stem horizontally at a point one inch above the minimum length for the grade. If the deviation of the flower head is more than 30&deg; from the horizontal (with the natural curvature down), the flower is considered defective. Other defects include slab sides, bullheads, blown heads, singles, sleepy appearance, splits, discoloration, and damage from insects and diseases. Standard carnations are bunched, and tied at the base and at least one other place below the flower heads. Instead of different colored labels, some growers indicate different grades by the color and/or number of rubber bands on each bunch. Standards for miniature carnation bunches vary; a bunch normally contains a minimum of 30 buds total, at least 7 of which are open. With standard carnations, flower heads may be alternated (5 high, 5 low) at the top of the bunch to produce a neat and compact bunch and reduce the risk of neck breakage.<br /><br /><a href=""http://ucanr.org/sites/postharvest/pfornamentals/CarnationPhotos/?repository=30034&amp;a=83774""><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></a></p>
<p>Carnations are ethylene sensitive and exposure to ethylene causes premature petal wilting (referred to as &lsquo;sleepiness&rsquo;). Some of the newer cultivars are less sensitive to ethylene than the standard &lsquo;Sim&rsquo; types, and carnations have now been genetically modified by the addition of a mutation of the ethylene binding site that makes them insensitive to ethylene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Carnation flowers must be pre-treated with 1-MCP or STS. Research shows that the effectiveness of 1-MCP is lost within a week at room temperature, but is retained for extended periods when carnations are held at low temperatures. Pulsing the treated flowers overnight with a preservative containing 10% sucrose improves flower opening and quality carnation buds can be opened, at room temperature and under normal room lighting, in a solution containing 7% sucrose and 200 ppm Physan&reg;. The buds should have been treated, first, with 1-MCP or STS.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Carnations should be stored at 0-1&deg;C. Bud-harvested flowers perform best in storage because they are less sensitive to ethylene than mature flowers. Flowers or buds for storage should be of the highest quality and absolutely free of pests and diseases. They should be treated with 1-MCP or STS and a fungicide for Botrytis control then packed in a box lined with polyethylene and newspaper. Open flowers can be stored 2 to 4 weeks, while bud-cut flowers can be safely stored up to 4 or 5 weeks. There are methods available for storing buds for up to four months.</p>

<p><em>Dendranthema x grandiflorum</em> Less important than formerly, but still an important cut flower, chrysanthemums (which come in a wide range of colors and forms, including standard and spray, or pompon) have a long postharvest life when properly handled. The chief postharvest problems in these flowers are failure to draw water (which results in premature leaf wilting) and leaf yellowing. Chrysanthemum is Greek for &ldquo;golden flower.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">Quality Indices</span></strong></p>
<p>Standard chrysanthemums are normally harvested fully open, or nearly so, and pompons are harvested with the most mature flowers fully open. Harvesting too early may result in failure of the flowers to open. However, chrysanthemums can be harvested as quite tight buds and opened satisfactorily with simple bud-opening solutions. Bud-cut standards can be harvested when the inflorescence is about 5 cm across or greater and opened into full-sized flowers. Spray varieties can be harvested when most of the petals on the most mature flower are still upright. The flowers can be opened after storage or transportation. Stems should be cut (with a knife, shears) at least 10 cm above the soil line to avoid taking woody plant tissue. Pinched spray chrysanthemums can be pulled from the soil and then cut to correct length. Leaves are removed from the lower third of the stems. Proper rehydration is vital for good vase life of chrysanthemums that have been stored or shipped long distances. Remove chrysanthemum bunches from the boxes, re-cut stems (remove about 1 inch) and place in a good rehydration solution. Educate workers and customers to accept flowers that are from two thirds to three quarters open as these flowers will last longer than tighter harvested ones.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Standard chrysanthemums are graded by length, and packed individually. Spray-types are graded by length and bunched. Standards or disbuds of equal sizes are graded into groups of 10 or 12. Each bunch of 5-8 spray chrysanthemums should be sleeved with plastic to prevent flowers from becoming entangled. Standards and spider mums can be wrapped individually with thin wax paper to avoid bruising and entangling florets. Some growers place nets over spider mums in the greenhouse before the buds open.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are not sensitive to ethylene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Stems should be placed in a rehydration solution, or water containing a germicide soon after harvest if they are not to be packed immediately. Immersion in solutions of the cytokinin 6-benzyl adenine has been shown to be effective in preventing premature leaf yellowing in some spray cultivars that are prone to this problem. This treatment is not yet used commercially. Bud-harvested flowers can be opened in fresh-flower solutions containing 2-3% sugar (higher concentrations damage the leaves) at 15 to 20&deg;C with 16 hours per day of normal room intensity light. Physan&reg; is a common, effective germicide, but it discolors the stem portion in the solution; therefore only 3 to 8 cm of solution should be used. After the buds are open, the injured portion of the stem can be removed. Silver nitrate at 25 ppm + citric acid at 75 ppm are very effective but more expensive to use than Physan. Silver nitrate is, however, absorbed into the stem and becomes a lasting germicide throughout the life of the flower. HQC at 200 ppm has similar beneficial effects.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Chrysanthemums should normally be stored at 0-1&deg;C. Bud-cut standard chrysanthemums harvested when the bud is 3 inches across can be stored up to 2 weeks and 4 inch buds for up to 3 weeks at 32-1&deg;C. Bud-cut stems that are held in cold storage beyond the recommended time can develop flat-topped flowers. Fully mature blooms can be stored dry (wrapped in polyethylene) for 3 to 4 weeks at 0&deg;C. Storage at 0-1&deg;C should not exceed 2 weeks. Yellowing of leaves can occur at 5&deg;C in the dark but is less likely to occur at 1&deg;C.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are normally packed in standard horizontal fiberboard boxes. Standards are packed individually, and often a layer of wax paper separates each row of flower heads.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>The main postharvest problems for chrysanthemums are premature foliage yellowing, wilting and the failure of the flowers to fully open. Yellow foliage is cultivar specific and is caused by poor production, excessive or improper storage and preservative solutions used at higher than recommended concentrations. The bottom portion of some mum stems can be woody: make sure these stems are cut above this woody tissue in order to facilitate water uptake, delay wilting and extend end-user life.</p>

<p><em>Narcissus</em> cvs. Daffodils, symbols of spring and known for their bright yellow, orange, red, pink, and white colors, are garden favorites world-wide. Unfortunately, these flowers have relatively short vase lives that cannot as yet be increased substantially with standard postharvest treatments. Narcissus is a classical Latin name, from the Greek; perhaps as the origin suggests, an allusion to narcotic properties. It is not clear whether it was named after the youth Narcissus in mythology.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Daffodils are normally harvested at the ""goose-neck"" stage. Jonquils are often harvested at the ""one bell"" stage, when only one flower is open on the spike. Harvesting is normally done by simply cutting the flower from the foliage and bulb, although the whole plant may be removed and the bulb and leaves then cut from the flower spike. Flowers should be purchased in the pencil to gooseneck stages. These terms refer to the flower position relative to the stem; pencil being straight up and gooseneck bent downwards to about a 45 degree angle.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>As with a number of other ""spike""-type flowers, narcissus will bend upwards away from gravity if laid down flat. For this reason flowers should be kept vertical when they are not cooled to the proper storage temperature. Although there are no formal grade standards for these flowers, the most important quality attributes are maturity, uniformity of color, and freedom from damage or disease. The flowers are normally bunched in groups of 10 or 25, tied with twist&rsquo;ems and sleeved in paper or plastic.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Senescence of these flowers is accelerated by exposure to ethylene, although their natural senescence does not involve ethylene. Pretreatment with 1-MCP or STS may extend flower life where flowers are handled in ethylene-polluted environments such as mass market outlets.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Pretreatment with 1-MCP or STS can help extend vase life of flowers that are likely to be exposed to ethylene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Store daffodils and jonquils at 0-1&deg;C. Store upright as these flowers will bend upwards from gravity. Narcissus can be stored at 1&deg;C and 90% relative humidity for up to 2 weeks with only slight reduction in their vase life. They may also be stored for several weeks in an atmosphere of 100% nitrogen. Narcissus stored in this way have as long a vase life as fresh cut flowers and nearly double the vase life of air-stored flowers. The flowers are best stored upright and dry, in containers that permit rapid cooling of the flowers (e.g. in fiberboard boxes).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Because of their sensitivity to gravity daffodils are often packed in hampers, although they may be packed in horizontal fiberboard boxes if they are properly pre-cooled and maintained at the correct storage temperature.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Daffodils exude a gelatinous (slimy) substance that, when transferred through a common holding solution to other flowers like tulips and anemone, can result in premature death for the other species. Therefore, place freshly cut or re-cut flowers into a separate holding bucket for a few hours. Later they can be placed with other flowers and used (even re-cut if required) in arrangements without affecting the life of the other flowers.</p>

<p><em>Eucalyptus</em> spp. The silvery-green leaves of the juvenile form of <em>Eucalyptus pulverulenta</em> are a very popular foliage item, used in fresh and dried form. A number of other species of Eucalyptus also are used as cut foliage. Eucalyptus is Greek for well and lid, referring to the sepals and petals, which are united to form a cap that is shed when the flower opens, revealing the showy colored stamens.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>As with other foliage, Eucalyptus performs better in the vase if the leaves are mature. Branches are harvested so as to provide long stem lengths, but leaving growing points behind for the development of new branches. Stem tips should not be wilted at time of purchase.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Quality foliage is bright blue-green in color, has undamaged leaves, and is uniform in length. Eucalyptus branches are sold in grower bunches by weight, usually as 1 pound bunches.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Eucalyptus branches are not sensitive to ethylene, but if the foliage is poorly handled, is warm, and water-stressed, it can produce concentrations of ethylene that could damage ethylene-sensitive flowers that have not been treated with 1-MCP or STS.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>No pretreatments are required.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Eucalyptus foliage should be stored at 0-1&deg;C.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Eucalyptus is normally packed in horizontal fiberboard boxes without additional packing materials.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Handle this species with gloves to prevent hands from becoming sticky. Eucalyptuses are native to areas like Australia and Tasmania but over 200 species have been introduced elsewhere. As a result, this species predominates in certain woodlands in California. Many florists believe eucalyptus gives off a lot of ethylene because of its strong fragrance. In fact, most species and cultivars do not produce excessive amounts of ethylene gas, although some will produce potentially detrimental quantities of ethylene if they become water stressed. Hence, make sure this species is properly hydrated. Eucalyptus can be treated with various colored glycerin-based solutions, which result in preserved specimens. Australian and Israeli researchers are investigating the possible use of Eucalyptus as flowering branches, and we may expect to see this interesting item increasing in the trade in the future.</p>

<p><em>Freesia</em> x cvs. Native to South Africa, the single or double flowers range in colors from yellow, orange, red, bronze, to purple. Some cultivars retain the delightful fragrances that are common in garden freesias. The genus was named for Dr. Freese (1785-1876), a native of Kiel, Germany and a student of South African plants.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Stems are harvested when the first flower colors and opens. Several flowering stems may be harvested from one plant. In that case, the uppermost flower stem should be cut just above the junction of the desired lateral flowering stem. When the lateral stem reaches maturity, it too is harvested. The upper flowering stem will have more flowers per stem and better postharvest life than lateral flowering stems. One or two florets per stem should be just beginning to open at the time of harvest and hence, at the time of purchase. If harvested too tight, many florets may not open unless preservative solutions are used properly. Learn cultivar names and market those that have good postharvest characteristics.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no standard grades for freesias, but they may be graded according to maturity, number of flowers per stem and the length of stem. Quality freesias have at least 7 florets per spike, and have long straight stems. Flowers are sold in bunches of 10 stems, usually of the same color.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">Ethylene Sensitivity</span></strong></p>

<p><em>Gerbera jamesonii</em> and hybrids. Cut gerbera flowers, known for their remarkable variety in coloration and form, are an increasingly important part of the florists&rsquo; palette. Their postharvest life can be substantial if they are given proper postharvest conditions, but they are sensitive to gravity, to light, and to bacterial contamination of the vase solution. Originally spelled &ldquo;Gerberia,&rdquo; the genus was named after Traug Gerber, a German naturalist.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Most gerbera varieties should be harvested when the 2 outer rows of disk florets have begun to open, but some cultivars can be harvested later, particularly those types that close at night. Flowers are harvested by twisting the stems off near the point of attachment to the rhizome; this is thought to encourage subsequent flower production. If flower stems are pulled from the ground, immediately cut 10 cm from the bottom to remove the &lsquo;woody&rsquo; base of the stem, which does not draw water readily. Place soon after harvest in a solution containing 40 ppm hypochlorite. Make sure that at least one or two row of disk flowers (tubular flowers in the center of the head) is showing pollen. If stems were pulled from the ground, cut 10 cm off the bottom to remove the woody portion and improve water uptake. With well over 300 cultivars in commerce that vary greatly in vase life, it is important that florists order gerberas by cultivar name. Unfortunately, the large number of cultivars makes it difficult to learn the names of better cultivars.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Maturity, freedom from defects, and stem length, strength and straightness are important quality criteria for gerberas. Some producers bunch the flowers, but most pack them individually. Some producers place each flower into a firm plastic sleeve, and may insert the stem into a plastic tube to reduce stem bending.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Gerberas are unaffected by exposure to ethylene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Present industry practice is to place cut gerbera stems in a 40 ppm sodium hypochlorite solution immediately after harvest to improve vase life. A rapid pulse treatment with 100 ppm silver nitrate is sufficient to greatly alleviate postharvest problems with gerbera cultivars that are relatively short-lived. The silver nitrate presumably guards against bacterial contamination of the stem and vase water. After the dip, rinse the flowers in good quality water. This treatment causes only minimum phytotoxicity (brown damage to the stem). The use of 6% sugar + 200 ppm 8-HQC as a preservative has shown to be of some benefit but can cause stem elongation during storage and may reduce overall flower quality.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Gerberas should be stored at 0-1&deg;C; the widely-held opinion that gerberas are sensitive to chilling injury has not been scientifically substantiated. Generally, gerberas should not be stored longer than 1 week; even this short storage period can reduce subsequent vase life.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Most commonly, producers pack individual flowers horizontally in shallow cardboard containers especially designed to support gerberas. Flower stems are passed through slits in the bottom of a cardboard tray so that the flower heads face up showing their colors while the stems pass under the box. Several rows of flowers can be arranged in each box. The boxes are then hung so that the stems dangle downward and can be placed in a rehydration solution (hypochlorite is most commonly used). Afterward, 2 trays of flowers are packed horizontally into a fiberboard box in such a way that the flowers are facing upward and easily seen, while the stems are underneath the flower cards.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Stem bending is primarily in response to gravity, and is greatly reduced if flowers are held at the proper storage temperature. One of the major problems in postharvest handling of these flowers is their tendency to 'conk' (folding of the stem, 10 to 15 cm below the flower head), resulting in an unmarketable flower. This bending has been variously attributed to harvesting of the flower before the stem has hardened sufficiently, and/or microbial plugging of the stem and subsequent water stress. The tendency to conk varies with variety and also varies throughout the year for any given variety. Be sure to enhance water uptake by keeping holding solutions and buckets clean and including hypochlorite in the water. Since more water is lost through the flower stem (scape) than through the flower petals, the scapes should be handled with as much care as the flowers themselves. Hang flower heads through a meshed support or shipping tray when first hydrating to keep stems straight.</p>

<p><em>Gladiolus</em> cvs. hybrids. Still an important commercial cut flower despite a substantial decline in production in recent years, gladiolus responds well to proper postharvest management. The smaller-flowered and &lsquo;butterfly&rsquo; cultivars, as well as modern standards in a variety of colors and forms have helped transform this often stereotypic funeral flower into a contemporary favorite that can be an important accent flower in arrangements. Gladiolus is Latin for small sword, in reference to the sword-shaped leaves. Modern day gladioli are the results of hybridization programs, using South African species, that commenced in Belgium around 1841.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Normal harvest is at the stage when the bottom two or three florets on the spike are showing color. For long-distance transportation, an even earlier harvest stage can be recommended if it is combined with sugar pulsing to ensure proper opening of the flowers at their destination. Local market flowers are cut when the first floret is open. Harvesting is carried out so as to leave as many leaves on the plant as possible. A knife is run down between the leaves with the back of the knife down. When the knife blade is as low as the cutter believes it should go, it is pulled upward and out, severing the stem, which can then be pulled out of the leaves. It is possible to open almost all florets on flower spikes if they are harvested in the green bud stage and handled properly. However, it is recommended that color should be visible in one to three florets at time of purchase to help ensure that most florets will open.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Gladioli, like most spike-type flowers, are very sensitive to the force of gravity, and will always tend to grow away from the ground, particularly at warm temperatures. This can result in permanent deformation of the upper part of the spike, and consequent reduction of flower quality. Throughout the postharvest procedures, gladioli should be held upright to avoid this effect. This rule may be relaxed only while the flowers are held at low temperature during storage and transportation. Quality factors for gladiolus include stem straightness and strength, freedom from damage and disease, and maturity. The flowers are bunched by color and maturity in groups of 10.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Although exposure to ethylene does not affect the life of open florets, it can reduce the flower life by causing abortion of unopened buds (Serek et al., 1995).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Gladioli respond very well to pulsing with a preservative containing 20% sugar (sucrose or glucose). Pulse overnight at room temperature or in the cooler. The flowers can be pulsed in the dark. Treatment with 1-MCP or STS provides some protection against the effects of exposure to ethylene (which causes young buds to abort).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Although earlier recommendations were to store gladiolus at 5&ordm;C to prevent chill damage to tips, our research has shown that they can safely be stored for a week at 0-1&ordm;C. The flowers are negatively geotropic (they bend away from the force of gravity), so they are commonly stored and shipped upright. One beneficial aspect of low temperature handling and transportation is that this negative geotropic response is inhibited, allowing gladioli to be packed in the standard horizontal flower box. For longer storage, gladioli are best stored upright at the lowest safe storage temperature.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Traditionally packed in tall 'glad hampers' clearly marked for upright stacking. Since the advent of pre-cooling, some shippers have packed gladiolus in normal flower boxes. This practice is fairly safe if the flowers will remain refrigerated throughout the marketing chain, and will be removed from the box on arrival. Excessive moisture on the foliage should be avoided so as to minimize the risk of Botrytis infection.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">Special Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some cultivars are sensitive to fluoride which can result in deterioration of the petal margin (bleaching, water soaking, and then necrosis), failure of florets to open and develop normally, burning of the floret sheath, and marginal leaf scorch.</p>

<p><em>Heliconia humilis, Heliconia psittacorum</em>. The varied and fantastic forms and rich colors of the different species of Heliconia make them an important florist item, particularly prized for large and signature arrangements. Heliconia is named after Mount Helicon, the seat of the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts and sciences in Greek mythology. Like their god Apollo, the Muses supposedly remained young and beautiful forever like the long-lasting and elegant flowers of Heliconia. Lobster claw and Crab's claw are additional common names for flowers in this genus.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Heliconia are normally harvested fully mature &ndash; the flowers will not open past the stage at which they are harvested. While flowers last longer if the bracts are less open compared to more open, they generally do not open further after harvest and that may reduce their visual appeal. Therefore, the openness of the flower at purchase often is the most it ever will open. Consumer life varies greatly among species and cultivars, thus, learn species and cultivar differences.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>

However, no antitranspirant product is presently sold in the floral industry for this use.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Heliconias are native to the tropical Americas, and are therefore very sensitive to chilling injury. They should never be held at temperatures below 10-12.5&deg;C. Flowers may be stored in moist shredded newsprint, or in water at 12.5&deg;C.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>

<p>Exposure to ethylene results in loss of berries and leaves, and is a common problem in holly handled through mass market outlets.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Because of its ethylene sensitivity, holly should be pretreated with STS or 1-MCP, which prevents bud and leaf loss during marketing.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Holly should be stored at 0-1&deg;C, and may even be held for longer periods at lower but non-freezing temperatures.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Holly may be packed in hampers or horizontal boxes. In the past, the branches were treated with various solutions (containing naphthalene acetic acid, NAA) to reduce their sensitivity to ethylene, and were therefore sometimes packed (wet) in wax-treated cartons. The use of 1-MCP should greatly simplify the marketing of this product.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>There are major differences among holly types in their sensitivity to ethylene. For example, &lsquo;Burford&rsquo; is essentially insensitive to ethylene, while Chinese and English types are very sensitive. Therefore, know the type of holly being marketed. Some producers will dip holly into various solutions in an attempt to reduce fruit and leaf fall and/or package the product in such a way as to extend life. However, at wholesale or retail level there is presently no product that will retard fruit loss, other than STS. Treating with STS does reduce fruit and leaf fall. Do not pre-green arrangements with holly, as it will not last.</p>

<p><em>Iris</em> cvs. hybrids Because of their intense yellow, blue, and purple colors, and the elegant shape of their flowers and foliage, bulbous (Dutch) Iris are in considerable demand as cut flowers. Unfortunately, they are also one of the shortest-lived of the commercial cut flowers, and may not even open if handled improperly or held too long before sale. In recent years, other iris species, especially the &lsquo;flag&rsquo; or German iris, which have even shorter vase life, have also been used in the trade. Iris is Greek for &lsquo;rainbow&rsquo; in reference to the range of flower colors.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Iris grown at low temperature should be harvested more open than those grown in warmer conditions. Iris flowers are normally harvested at the ""pencil stage"", when a line of color projects out of the sheathing leaves. The 'Blue Ribbon' cultivar should be harvested more mature, when the edge of one petal is unfurled. Iris is pulled from the field at the correct stage of maturity. The bulb is cut off and the lower foliage removed. The flower stems are then placed in water. Wholesale and retail florists should purchase iris in the pencil stage. This term describes flowers that exhibit a line of color vertically, as the sheathing leaves covering them unfurls, but before the flower petals reflex. A major exception is the cultivar &lsquo;Blue Ribbon,&rsquo; which should be more open at the time of purchase.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no formal grade standards for iris flowers. Flowers should be uniform in variety, color, and maturity. Foliage should be relatively undamaged and free from disease. Stems should be strong and straight. Flowers are normally bunched in 10s, then the bunches are tied with rubber bands or twist-ems.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Iris is not affected by exposure to ethylene.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no recommended pretreatments for iris flowers.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Store iris dry, upright, at 0&deg;C for no more than one week. Some growers store iris with the bulb attached. Prolonged storage may result in failure of flowers to open (especially the 'Blue Ribbon' cultivar). Storage at warmer temperatures will result in &lsquo;popping&rsquo; of the flower when it is rehydrated.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Iris is normally packed in upright hampers.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Researchers have obtained some increase in the vase life of iris by including a high concentration of benzyladenine in the vase solution, and pretreatments with gibberellins have been shown to overcome the negative effects of dry storage.</p>

<p><em>Rumohra adiantiformis.</em> By far the most popular cut foliage for use in arrangements, with year-round availability and good display life. Leatherleaf fern is grown in shade-houses under sub-tropical conditions. The specific epithet adiantiformis indicates the similarity to the fronds of Adiantum, the maidenhair fern. The Greek ""adianton"" means unwettable - a reference to the fact that fern fronds shed water. It is probably the most commonly used floral green.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Frond curl or postharvest wilt is a disorder that occurs more frequently from July to November. The precise cause of this disorder is not known and it cannot be prevented at grower, wholesale, or retail levels. Water stress can make the frond curl worse; however, leatherleaf is very tolerant to water stress conditions when frond curl is not a problem. The use of some postharvest antitranspirant (wax-type) dips can enhance vase life but does not reduce frond curl. Dipping leatherleaf in plain tap water can reduce vase life. The brown bumps (sporophores, or sori) found on the back of some leaves (fronds) have no detrimental effect on life.</p>

Native to the prairies of North America, Liatris was developed as a cut flower in Israel. The bright purple spikes provide interesting texture and line in arrangements, and can open fully if properly treated after harvest.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Liatris spikes should be harvested with no more than one quarter to one third of the flowers in the spike open. They may be harvested with only the top buds showing color and will open fully if provided with an effective preservative.

However, if preservative solution is properly used, flowers can be harvested with no color showing and subsequently opened.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Quality Liatris flowers are of proper maturity (no more than one third of the flowers on the spike open), are free from defects and damage, and have good quality foliage.

<p>Introduced into cultivation from the prairies of Texas, production of lisianthus (<em>Eustoma grandiflora</em>) has increased dramatically in recent years, spurred by the development, largely in Japan, of excellent cultivars in a wide range of colors, and single and double forms.&nbsp;Properly pretreated, or with an adequate vase preservative, the flowers are long-lived in the vase.&nbsp; Each stem bears in excess of 8-10 buds and flowers, and several of the larger buds will open in the vase, if the flower is supplied with supplementary sugar.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity </strong></span></p>
<p>Stems are harvested when at least one flower is open.&nbsp;Some growers allow flowers to develop further so that the buds are more advanced, then remove the older flowers, leaving one or two flowers per stem.&nbsp; Although it takes extra labor, removal of immature shoots whose buds will not develop improves the display quality of the flower.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading &amp; Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no formal grade standards for lisianthus, but leaf mines and damage to the flower are obvious quality defects.&nbsp;Flowers are bunched, depending on market requirements into 5&rsquo;s or 10&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Lisianthus is sensitive to gravity, and stems will bend upwards if the flowers are held horizontal at ambient temperatures. For this reason, lisianthus that will not be properly pre-cooled is often packed and transported in vertical hampers.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Chemical Solutions </strong></span></p>
<p>Lisianthus is sensitive to some of the biocides in commercial preservatives, which cause browning of the stems.&nbsp;In our experiments, 200 ppm Al2(SO4)3 and 50 ppm hypochlorite (1 ml Clorox/liter of water) were excellent biocides for lisianthus.&nbsp;Although researchers have shown a slight reduction in life of lisianthus exposed to ethyhlene, the effect is minor, and anti-ethylene treatments (STS or EthylBloc) are of little benefit.&nbsp;We found that Lisianthus flowers were greatly improved by treatment with relatively high concentrations of sucrose &ndash; 3% in the vase solution, or a pretreatment for 24 hours with 12% sucrose and a biocide.&nbsp;Given these solutions the flowers opened more buds with improved color, lasted longer, and the pedicels (the stalks under the flowers) became much more rigid.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage </strong></span></p>
<p>Flowers for storage should be of highest quality, absolutely free from pests and diseases. Place them at 0.5&deg;C (33&deg;F) in a box lined with polyethylene and newspaper.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity </strong></span></p>
<p>Lisianthus flowers are only slightly sensitive to ethylene, which will cause earlier senescence of flowers that were mature at the time of ethylene exposure.&nbsp;Response to CA: <br />There have been no reports of beneficial effects of CA on lisianthus flowers.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Freezing Injury </strong></span></p>

<p><em>Cattleya, Cymbidium</em>, cvs. and hybrids. Additional genera in the plant family Orchidaceae are Dendrobium, Phalaenopsis, Vanda and Paphiopedilum. In addition to their exotic forms and colors, one of the principal attractions of cut orchid flowers is their outstanding longevity. Even out of water, an orchid flower will last for an evening in a corsage. Spikes of cymbidiums will often last a month in a vase.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Orchid flowers are usually harvested 3 to 4 days after opening, because flowers cut prematurely will fail to develop normally off the plant. Early and late in the season, individual flowers are cut from the spike as they develop, because prices are high at these times. In mid-season, the whole spike is cut. Virus diseases can be spread from plant to plant during harvest, so cutting tools should be sterilized before being used on the next plant or disposable razor blades should be used. As individual flowers, purchase when fully opens. Spikes should be purchased when at least two flowers per spike are open.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no formal grade standards for orchids. Freedom from defects is a primary measure of quality.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>

<p>Pretreatment with 1-MCP is very effective in preventing the effects of ethylene and increasing the life of orchid flowers, and should be standard practice for these flowers.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Can range from 0 to 12.5&ordm;C depending on cultivar. Many cultivars are not chill sensitive and therefore can be stored as other cut flowers at 0-1&ordm;C. If feasible, leaving flowers on the plants at room temperature is a good storage procedure. Be careful not to remove or knock off the pollinia (anthers) as this causes an immediate surge in ethylene production, which, in turn, causes premature death.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Because of their fragility and relatively high value, most orchids are packed as individual flowers or spikes, frequently in shredded paper to cushion and protect them from mechanical injury to the blooms. They are then packed 12 to 24 flowers in each carton. Box inserts hold the individual water tubes stationary. Shredded wax paper is tucked around and between the flowers for additional protection.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Only some species and cultivars are ethylene sensitive which explains why anti-ethylene treatments like STS and 1-MCP work only some of the time. The two most common ethylene-induced symptoms are flower discoloration and premature wilting and flower fall. Demand has increased for this species prepared as a corsage and sold through mass market outlets at Easter and Mothers&rsquo; Day. When sold for corsages the use of water picks filled with fresh-flower solution (not plain tap water) is beneficial.</p>

<p>Proteaceae family. The family Proteaceae includes a diverse range of species of trees and shrubs in the genus Protea from southern Africa and of other genera from Australia whose branches and flowers are used for foliage and as cut flowers. The flowers are normally bird pollinated, and produce copious amounts of nectar, explaining the old Afrikaans name of &lsquo;sugar bush&rsquo;. The family name refers to the diversity of forms of the flowers. Additional genera are Banksia, Leucospermum, and Leucodendron.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">Quality Indices</span></strong></p>

<p>Proteas are normally packed in horizontal fiberboard boxes.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Leaves turn black due to lack of carbohydrate (food) and warm temperatures. Use preservative solutions and proper low temperature management to prevent leaf blackening. In addition, this disorder can be reduced if the flowers are held under lighted conditions. Leaf blackening is not due to low temperature (chill disorders), nor is it due to poor water relations. Many species and cultivars can be easily dried or preserved by just allowing them to dry under warm, low humidity conditions.</p>

<p><em>Rosa</em> cvs. hybrids. The rose undoubtedly remains the queen of the cut flowers. The historical association of this flower with romance and beauty ensures that roses will continue to be a highly desired cut flower in the future. Properly handled, most of the commercial cut roses will easily last in the vase for 10 days. Unfortunately, many consumers consider roses to have a very short vase life. This is partly because poor water uptake by certain cultivars of purchased roses all too often results in the symptom called ""bent neck"" in which the flower neck wilts, and the bud fails to open. We also have found that many commercial cultivars are quite sensitive to ethylene gas. The cut flower industry has an important stake in overcoming the poor postharvest reputation of the cut roses. All that is required is proper postharvest care for those cultivars susceptible to bent neck, and appropriate pre-treatment of those that are sensitive to ethylene, especially if they are to be sold in supermarkets or other ethylene polluted areas.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Roses are harvested at different levels of maturity, depending on marketing and cultivar. For long-distance transport or storage, roses should usually be harvested with some of the sepals reflexed. Flowers harvested before the sepals reflex may fail to open, or may be more susceptible to bent neck. Fast-opening roses, like some yellows and whites, should be harvested just before the sepals start to separate from the bud. The marketing life of roses harvested later will be reduced unless extra care is taken with their postharvest handling. Harvesting is most convenient using shears provided with auxiliary jaws to hold the bloom after harvest. The cut is normally made so as to leave 2 five-foliate leaves below the cut. When stem length is an important consideration, the cut may be made &lsquo;below Roses should be purchased and sold by cultivar name. Avoid blooms that are already open &ndash; flowers should normally have some or all of their sepals (the green protective &lsquo;leaves&rsquo; at the base of the flower) folded back, but the petals should not have started unfolding. Brown spots or patches on the outer petals may be an indication of Botrytis infection.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Objective grading is based on stem length; subjective grading is based on flower maturity, stem straightness, stem caliper, and quality of flower and foliage. Defects on the outer ""guard"" petals are not normally a cause for down-grading, because these petals are removed by the retail florist. Leaves and thorns may be removed manually or mechanically if desired. This operation has little effect on vase life if flowers are placed in an effective preservative. The number of stems per bunch, and bunch pattern (single layer, staggered two-layer) depends on market preferences.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Some cultivars are ethylene sensitive. Treat with 1-MCP or STS if they are being distributed through the mass markets, especially if being shipped through distribution centers, and also treat to prevent the effects of the ethylene prior to dry storage.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Roses should be stored, dry, at 0-1&deg;C. Roses intended for long-term storage should be packed in polyethylene-lined cartons and pre-cooled. They may be held for up to 2 weeks in dry storage if the temperature is maintained steady and close to the freezing point.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Rose bunches are routinely sleeved in plastic, waxed paper, or soft corrugated card sleeves. The &lsquo;spiral&rsquo; bunch used by many off-shore producers increases the difficulty of pre-cooling the flowers, and the opportunity for condensation collecting on the outer petals. Botrytis infection is a common result of the presence of free moisture on the petals of cut roses.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Removal of those leaves and thorns below the water line should not reduce vase life if the stems are placed into a preservative solution. The fungus Botrytis represents a major problem for roses. Symptoms of Botrytis infection include brown blotches on petals and gray, fuzzy growth on leaves, stems or flowers. Postharvest fungicide dip can be helpful - use only registered products according to label instructions. Petal blackening on some red cultivars is due to the growing conditions, and cannot be corrected at wholesale or retail levels.</p>

<p><em>Antirrhinum majus</em> cvs. The many pastel flower colors of the tall spikes of snapdragons allow florists and consumers innumerable design options. Snapdragons used to be considered very sensitive to ethylene, but the newer cultivars have been selected for ethylene resistance, and ethylene normally causes a problem only when present in moderate concentrations. Flower drop (shattering) occurs in 24 hours if ethylene is present in the air at concentrations of 0.5 ppm or more. Antirrhinum is Greek for &ldquo;like&rdquo; and &ldquo;nose&rdquo; in reference to the flower shape.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>For local sales, snapdragons are typically harvested when the flowers on the lower one-half to two-thirds of the spike are open. A less mature stage is desirable for shipping and/or short term storage. Purchase those cultivars that are less sensitive to ethylene. At least two to five florets per stem should be open. Avoid flowers with excessive stem bending and yellowing foliage, which indicate poor temperature management after harvest.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Snapdragons are bunched in groups of 10 by color. Flowers must have straight stems and reasonably healthy foliage. Foliage on the lower third of the stem should be removed.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Most snapdragon cultivars are sensitive to ethylene. Older flowers on a stem are more susceptible to ethylene than younger ones. However, some cultivars are naturally ethylene resistant and, therefore, respond little to treatment with 1-MCP or STS.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Treatment with 1-MCP or pulsing with STS protects snapdragon flowers from ethylene-induced shattering. Snapdragons also benefit from an overnight pulse at 20&deg;C with a preservative fortified with 7% sucrose. Upper flowers on spikes treated in this way open with better color than control flowers. Snapdragons are best stored with only a few flowers open, but this often results in poor development of the flowers on the spike and fading of color at the tip. Spikes cut with only one or two flowers open should be opened in a solution containing 300 ppm 8-hydroxyquinoline citrate (8-HQC) and 1.5% sucrose. This bud-opening solution can also be used as a vase solution. Addition of 25 ppm of the growth regulator n-dimethylamino succinamic acid (Alar, B-nine) increases flower quality and also counteracts the excess spike length that sometimes results from placing snapdragons in 8-HQC and sucrose. Pulse treatments with naphthylpthalamic acid or Ca++ antagonists can reduce geotropic curvature that results from horizontal storage at warmer temperatures.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Snapdragons can be stored at 0-1&deg;C for 7 to 10 days if they are wrapped in polyethylene film to retard moisture loss. Snapdragons have been satisfactorily stored for up to 3 weeks at -1&deg;C. For long-term storage, bud-harvested flowers should be used. Bud-harvested flowers are ones in which the bottom two or three florets have colored petals emerging about one-quarter of an inch above the calyx. Snapdragons are relatively sensitive to ethylene gas. Flowers on harvested spikes assume a permanent, upward bend, thus reducing quality, if held at warmer temperatures for even a short time in a non-vertical position. Snapdragons should always be stored and shipped upright in snapdragon hampers at low temperatures. Pretreatment with naphthyphthalamic acid can overcome this bending, but it is not registered for this purpose.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Snapdragons are usually packed upright in hampers or Proconas, which reduce the likelihood of geotropic bending. If the flowers are properly pre-cooled and transported at optimal storage temperatures (0-1&deg;C) they can be packed in a normal horizontal flower box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Do not remove more leaves than necessary, as this can stimulate flower fall. Do not use any home brews (i.e. anti-freeze) as replacements for preservative solutions. The many pastel flower colors allow florists and consumers innumerable options. The flower can be made to snap shut after separating and releasing the two-lipped corolla (fused petals). When grown as a garden plant, treat them as an annual although many will respond as a perennial, depending on location and cultivar.<br /><br />Source: Perishables Handling #92, November 1997</p>

<p><em>Limonium</em> spp., <em>Goniolimon.</em> A traditional filler flower, the standard statice (<em>Limonium sinuatum</em>) comes in a range of pastel colors, and is widely used both fresh and dried. Other species of Limonium are sold in the trade as &lsquo;german&rsquo;, &lsquo;latifolia&rsquo;, &lsquo;sea foam&rsquo; and &lsquo;caspia&rsquo; statice. Hybrid Limonium cultivars, grown from tissue culture, have become very popular in recent years. Their vase life is greatly improved by pretreatments to prevent the effects of ethylene and to improve bud opening.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Standard statice is harvested fully open, but before the true flowers (small white flowers within the brightly colored bracts) senesce. Hybrid statice cultivars should be harvested when the first flower on each spike is open. Avoid bunches where flowers have yellowing stems and leaves, as well as bunches with obvious fungal growth or wilted flowers. Remove from shipping boxes and re-cool flowers immediately. Also remove stem ties and separate stems to improve air circulation and reduce the likelihood of Botrytis infection.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Quality statice is of the correct maturity, and is free of defects and disease. Standard statice is normally bunched in 25&rsquo;s; other cultivars are bunched by bunch size. Sleeves help to prevent tangling of the delicate branchlets.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Statice flowers are sensitive to ethylene, which causes accelerated wilting. In standard statice this effect is not apparent, since the &lsquo;flowers&rsquo; are papery bracts surrounding the true flowers. In the hybrid statice cultivars, effective treatments to inhibit the action of ethylene greatly improve flower quality and vase life.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Hybrid statice benefits enormously from pretreatment with STS or 1-MCP, and pulse pre-treatment with a sugar solution containing 10% sugar and 200 ppm Physan-20 for 12 hours. The sucrose present in the preservative extends the life of the individual florets, as well as promotes flower opening resulting in up to 3-fold increases in the longevity of the inflorescences (Burge et al., 1998).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Statice should be stored, dry, at 0-1&deg;C. Statice intended for long-term storage should be packed in polyethylene-lined cartons and pre-cooled. They may be held for up to 2 weeks in dry storage if the temperature is maintained steady and close to the freezing point.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Statice is normally packed in horizontal fiberboard boxes.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Many statice species can be dried and used for years in permanent flower arrangements. Yet, when used as a fresh flower, they may last only a few days before leaf yellowing (on statice only, not German statice) or Botrytis infestation occurs. Storing statice under lights can retard leaf yellowing, but this may be hard to do in commercial practice.</p>

<p><em>Helianthus annuus.</em> In recent years, smaller cultivars of sunflower have become a very popular florist item, and a range of forms and colors are now widely available in the trade. Helianthus is derived from the Greek &lsquo;helios&rsquo;, the sun, and &lsquo;anthos&rsquo;, a flower.<br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small; color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Sunflowers are normally harvested when the &lsquo;petals&rsquo; (the outer flowers or ligules) have unfolded and are at least vertical. For local market, flowers are harvested with the ligules fully expanded and horizontal. No yellow or wilted leaves should be present. Length of life often is determined more by leaf yellowing or desiccation than by flower problems.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Quality sunflowers are of uniform maturity, are free from defects, have straight stems, and have good quality foliage. Smaller-flowered cultivars may be bunched in 10&rsquo;s or 12&rsquo;s, and large-flowered types are normally packed individually.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Prolonged exposure of sunflowers to low concentrations of ethylene results in abscission of ligules.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>The tendency for sunflowers to wilt prematurely in the vase can be avoided by pre-treating the flowers (15 to 30 minutes) with clean water containing 0.02% detergent (Tween-20, Triton X-100, dishwashing detergent).<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Sunflowers can safely be stored at 0-1&ordm;C. Packing Sunflowers are normally packed in standard horizontal flower boxes.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Sunflowers are also somewhat sensitive to gravity. If held horizontal at warmer temperatures the flower heads will be permanently bent down, so it is important to maintain cool temperatures during transport and storage.</p>

<p><em>Lathyrus odoratus.</em> Once important cut flowers, prized for their aroma and range of colors, sweet peas benefit substantially from anti-ethylene pretreatments. Combined with a sugar pulse, treatment with STS or 1-MCP enables these delicate flowers to be harvested at an earlier stage when the flowers are less susceptible to damage, and to give as much as a week of display life.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Sweet peas are traditionally harvested when the last bud on the stem is about half open. ""Bud-stage"" flowers are harvested when the petals on the first bud are colored and near full size, but have not yet opened. Flowers are harvested by holding the stem between the thumb and forefinger near the base (supporting the vine with two fingers behind and one in front) and then pulling the flower backwards and upwards from the axil of the leaf. Sweet peas should have 5 flowers per stem and only one flower open at the time of purchase. Avoid bunches with wilting flowers or where buds or flowers have fallen.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>There are no grade standards for sweet peas, but quality flowers have long, straight stems and at least five buds on each spike. Flowers can be bunched by color, or in mixed colors, in bunches of 10.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Exposure to ethylene results in accelerated wilting of petals, abscission of flowers, and failure of developing buds to open.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Proper pretreatment greatly improves the vase life of sweet peas. Flowers should be treated with 1-MCP or STS, and then placed in a preservative solution containing 4% sucrose at 20&deg;C overnight.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>Sweet peas should be stored at 0-1&deg;C. Flowers that have been pretreated with 1-MCP and sucrose will open well and have a satisfactory vase life after storage for up to a week at 1&deg;C.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>

<p><em>Polianthes tuberosa.</em> Spikes of ivory flowers much prized in the East for their fragrance and by western florists for accents and bridal bouquets, tuberose flowers bear as many as 50 florets, in pairs, on a tall spike. The postharvest life of these flowers typically is limited by failure of developing buds to open, so that the life is determined by the life of the flowers that were open at harvest. Proper pre-treatments can greatly extend the life of tuberose, and should routinely be carried out with flowers intended for storage and transport.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>The flowers are normally harvested with 2-4 open blooms on the spike. Although earlier harvest provides a spike that is more resistant to transportation, the buds are unlikely to open after transport unless properly pre-treated. Flowers for the local market may be harvested with more open flowers on the spike. It is unfortunately difficult to determine whether tuberose flowers have been effectively pre-treated prior to purchase. Look for straight stems, unblemished blooms, and work with your supplier to ensure that the flowers have been properly pretreated.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Grading and Bunching</strong></span></p>
<p>Tuberose are sold in bunches of 10 stems.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Ethylene Sensitivity</strong></span></p>
<p>Floret opening is reduced in spikes exposed to high concentrations of ethylene, but this effect is probably not normally of commercial significance, so 1-MCP or STS treatments are not warranted for tuberose.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pretreatments</strong></span></p>
<p>Tuberose flowers should be pulsed for 24 h at room temperature with a preservative solution augmented with 20% sucrose. This pretreatment will significantly improve vase life and opening of buds on the flower spikes. Flowers to be pre-treated in this way should preferably be harvested dry, graded, bunched, and re-cut, then placed immediately in the pulsing solution.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Storage Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>The optimal temperature for cooling and storage of tuberose is 0&deg;C, but after only short periods of storage, the buds on the spike fail to open. Pulse pre-treatment with sucrose overcomes this problem, and after 6 days in storage the flowers open as well as freshly cut spikes.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Packing</strong></span></p>
<p>Tuberose may be packed in hampers or in horizontal fiberboard boxes. If packed horizontal, they should be held at the proper temperature to avoid geotropic curvature.<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>Florists often use individual tuberose blooms in corsages and boutonnieres. Proper pre-treatment of the spikes will ensure continued opening of the blooms in the florists&rsquo; workroom and consequent increased utility of each spike.</p>
