<p>The edible bud, composed of a cone of bracts, is harvested at an immature stage and selected for size and compactness. Overdeveloped buds have an open or spreading structure; the bracts have a brownish cast and are tough and stringy; the centers have a fuzzy, pink to purple appearance. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Quality indices are compact and well-formed buds, typical green color, a smooth and uniform stem-cut, freedom from insect damage or handling damage and defects. Artichoke buds should feel heavy for their size. Stems are generally cut 2.5 to 3.8 cm (1 to 1.5 in) below the base.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Responses to Ethylene </strong></span></p>

<p>Artichokes have a low sensitivity to exogenous ethylene and therefore it is not considered a factor in postharvest handling and distribution. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmospheres </strong></span></p>

<p>Controlled or modified atmospheres offer moderate to little benefit to sustaining artichoke quality. Conditions of 2-3% O<sub>2</sub> and 3-5% CO<sub>2</sub> delay discoloration of bracts and the onset of decay by a few days at temperatures around 5&deg;C (41&deg;F). Atmospheres below 2% O<sub>2</sub> may result in internal blackening of artichokes.</p>","
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: small; color: #663300;"">Physiological and Physical Disorders</span> </strong><br /><br /><em><strong>Freezing Injury</strong></em>. Freezing injury will be initiated at -1.2&deg;C (29.9&deg;F). Symptoms of light freezing injury are blistering of the cuticle and a bronzing of the outer bracts. This may occur in the field with winter harvested buds and is used in marketing as an index of high quality. More severe freeze injury results in watersoaked bracts and the heart becoming brown to black and gelatinous in appearance over time. <br /><br /><em><strong>Bruising and Compression Injury.</strong></em> Very common when attention to careful harvest and handling practices are not followed. <br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">Pathological Disorders </span></strong><br /><br /><em><strong>Grey Mold</strong></em> (<em>Botrytis cinerea</em>) and <strong><em>Bacterial Soft Rot</em></strong> (<em>Erwinia carotovora</em>) may be a problem in storage and distribution if optimum temperature conditions are not met. Opportunistic fungi (such as <em>Fusarium</em> spp.) may develop on cut stems or bracts with prolonged low temperature storage.</p>

<ul>
<li>Asparagus will continue to develop after harvest which is why low temperature postharvest management is critical. Common disorders include upward <em><strong>bending of tips</strong></em> away from gravity and ""feathering"" (expansion and opening) of tips. Bending will also occur if tips expand to the top of the packaging and are deflected</li>
<li><em><strong>Spear toughening</strong></em> occurs rapidly at temperatures above 10&deg;C (50&deg;F)</li>
<li><em><strong>Bruising </strong></em>and<em><strong> tip-breakage</strong></em> are signs of rough handling and can result in toughening of the spears from wound ethylene</li>
<li>Asparagus is sensitive to <em><strong>chilling injury</strong></em> after 10 days at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F). Symptoms of chilling injury include loss of sheen or glossiness and graying of the tips. A limp, wilted appearance may be observed. Severe chilling injury may result in darkening near tips in spots or streaks</li>
<li><em><strong>Freezing injury</strong></em> (water-soaked appearance leading to extreme softening) will likely result at temperatures of -0.6&deg;C (30.9&deg;F) or lower</li>
</ul>
<br /><br /><p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />The most 
prominent postharvest disease concern is <strong><em>bacterial soft rot</em></strong>, induced by <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. <em>carotovora</em>. Decay may initiate at the tips or the butt end. Spears that are re-cut above the white portion of the butt end are reported to be most susceptible to bacterial decay. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br />Rapid hydrocooling soon after harvest is strongly 
recommended. Pyramid-shaped wooden or waxed corrugated boxes for hydrocooling combined with center-loading during shipment promote good cooling-air circulation.</p>

The main benefit is retention of color and reduced discoloration on damaged beans. Higher CO<sub>2</sub> (20-30%) concentrations can be used for short periods, but can cause off-flavors.</p>

A less common symptom is pitting on the surface. The most common symptom of chilling injury is the appearance of discrete rusty brown spots which occur in the temperature range of 5-7.5&deg;C (41-45&deg;F). These lesions are very susceptible to attack by common fungal pathogens. Beans can be held about 2 days at 1&deg;C (34&deg;F), 4 days at 2.5&deg;C (36&deg;F), or 8-10 days at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) before chilling symptoms appear.

</div>","<p><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">General Information</span></strong></p>
<p>Witloof chicory or Belgian endive is a ""chicon"" or compact oval head of overlapping leaves produced from a harvested tap root. Forcing occurs in the dark at elevated temperatures 16-20&deg;C (60-68&deg;F) often in hydroponic trays and results in the cream-yellowish compact head or chicon after 3-4 weeks. Witloof chicory is a member of the lettuce family.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Maturity is based on chicon size and compactness and varies according to cultivar and the quality of the tap root (amount of carbohydrate reserves). The firm heads are harvested by snapping from the root.&nbsp; 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Quality is based on size, compactness, shape, and color. After trimming outer leaves, the chicons should be white with closed cream-yellow points and not have any torn leaves. Witloof chicory cultivars vary in flavor and bitterness (caused by sesquiterpene lactones). Chicons rapidly turn green if exposed to light and the flavor changes (see Special Considerations). Good quality chicons do not have any traces of green but are white with cream-yellow leaf edges.</p>

<p>Ethylene production rates of harvested chicons are &lt;0.1, 0.2, and 0.7 &micro;L/kg&middot;hr at 0, 10 and 20&deg;C (32, 50 and 68&deg;F), respectively.&nbsp; 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Ethylene </strong></span></p>

<p>Witloof chicory or Belgian endive is moderately sensitive to ethylene exposure. The main symptoms of ethylene injury are accelerated decay and discoloration of the leaf margins. Ethylene could also be expected to induce leaf abscission, but this effect may require a very long period at low storage temperatures.&nbsp; 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmosphere (CA) </strong></span></p>

<p>Some benefit to shelf-life can be obtained with low O<sub>2</sub> (3-4%) and high CO<sub>2</sub> to (4-5%) atmospheres at temperatures of 0-5&deg;C (32-41&deg;F). CA retards the development of browning on leaf edges. CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres also retard discoloration of the butt also. To control greening, extremely low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (&lt;0.1%) are required.</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Physiological and Physical Disorders </strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Internal 
Browning.</strong></em> The warm forcing conditions for witloof chicory production can cause browning of the chicon axis. This is thought to be due to a localized calcium deficiency in the rapidly developing head. <br /><br /><em><strong>Physical Injury</strong><strong>.</strong></em> Breakage of the outer leaf margins often occurs during harvest, trimming and packing and causes increased browning and increased susceptibility to bacterial decay.&nbsp; 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders </strong></span><br /><br />Decay is not a common cause of postharvest losses of 
witloof chicory. However, bacterial rots caused by numerous bacteria (<em>Erwinia, Pseudomonas </em>and <em>Xanthomonas</em> spp.) can occur and result in a slimy breakdown of the infected tissue. Trimming outer leaves, rapid cooling and low storage temperature reduce development of bacterial rots. Sanitation during initial harvest, trimming and washing reduce bacterial decays.&nbsp; 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br />Exposure to light causes the chicons to turn green and 
become unmarketable. Packaging in paper liners in unvented boxes ensures dark storage during distribution. However at retail, the chicons will turn green within a few hours at 10-15&deg;C (50-59&deg;F) of exposure to display lights. Therefore only a few should be removed from the box at a time to reduce exposure to light. Another option is to place the chicons in a plastic box with a lid that excludes light. If kept cold 0-5&deg;C (32-41&deg;F) it takes longer than 2 days for greening to occur.</p>

<p>Broccoli can be benefitted by 1-2% O<sub>2</sub> with 5-10% CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres at a temperature range of 0-5&deg;C (32-41&deg;F). Although under controlled conditions such low O<sub>2 </sub>levels extend shelf-life, temperature fluctuations during commercial handling make this risky as broccoli can easily produce offensive sulfur-containing volatiles. As a result, a high rate of air exchange is recommended in standard marine container shipments of broccoli. Most modified atmosphere packaging for broccoli is designed to maintain O<sub>2</sub> at 3-10% and CO<sub>2</sub> at about 7-10% to avoid the development of these undesirable off-odor volatiles.</p>

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Brussels sprouts are the compact vegetative buds that develop along the stem of the Brussels sprouts plant. They should be harvested when the buds are firm, but not overmature which is indicated by splitting of the outer leaves. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Good quality Brussels sprouts should be bright green, without yellowing or discoloration, and have a firm texture. The butt end may be slightly discolored, but should not be dark. Brussels sprouts should be sweet and mild in flavor when cooked. Bitterness varies among cultivars and is associated with high concentrations of specific glucosinolates (sinigrin and progoitrin). Bitterness can also be induced by storage conditions (see Responses to Controlled Atmospheres).</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature and Relative Humidity </strong></span></p>

<p>Brussels sprouts are moderately perishable and can be stored 3-5 weeks at temperatures near the optimum of 0&deg;C (32&deg;F). Shelf life at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) is 10-18 days and at 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) is less than 7 days. Brussels sprouts are often hydrocooled, but can be air cooled as well. Although they have considerable wax on their leaves, they become flaccid due to water loss if high relative humidity is not maintained.&nbsp; <br /><br /><em><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Freezing Injury. </span></strong></span></em>Brussels sprouts freeze at about -0.6&deg;C (30.9&deg;F). 
Slight freeze damage on the outer leaves of buds may result in small dark and translucent areas. Severe freeze damage results in the entire bud becoming dark and translucent, and very soft after thawing.</p>

<p>Brussels sprouts can be benefited by 1-4% O<sub>2</sub> with 5-10% CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres at 2.5-5&deg;C (32-41&deg;F). The main benefits are reduced yellowing and decay, reduced butt discoloration and inhibition of ethylene production. No benefits of CA are observed if the Brussels sprouts are kept at their optimum storage temperature 0&deg;C (32&deg;F). Low oxygen storage (&lt;1%) can cause extreme bitterness and may also cause internal discoloration.

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Round hard cabbages and Chinese (also called Napa) cabbages are from the same genus (<em>Brassica</em>) but different species (<em>B. oleracea</em> var <em>capitata</em> = cabbage, <em>B. campestris</em> var. <em>pekinensis</em> = Chinese cabbage). Chinese cabbages may be cylindrical or rounded and may be less compact than round cabbages. Information mentioned here applies to both types unless stated otherwise.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Maturity is based on head compactness. A compact head can be only slightly compressed with moderate hand pressure. A very loose head is immature, and a very firm or hard head is mature.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>After trimming outer wrapper leaves, cabbage heads should be a color typical of the cultivar (green, red, or pale yellow-green), firm, heavy for the size and free of insect, decay, seed stalk development and other defects. Leaves should be crisp and turgid. For round cabbages, grades are U.S. No. 1 and U.S. commercial.</p>","<p><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">Optimum Temperature</span></strong></p>
<p>Most cabbage is room cooled. Storage at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) is required to optimize cabbage storage life. Early crop round cabbage can be stored 3-6 weeks, while late crop cultivars can be stored for up to 6 months. For the latter, storage at -0.5&deg;C (31&deg;F) is sometimes recommended. Chinese cabbage can be stored from 2 to 6 months, depending on cultivar, at 0&deg;C to 2.5&deg;C (32&deg;F to 36&deg;F). Deterioration of cabbage during storage is associated with stem or seed stalk growth (bolting), root growth, internal breakdown, leaf abscission, discoloration, decay and black speck. Long-term storage usually results in extensive trimming of heads to remove deteriorated leaves.<br /><br /><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Freezing Injury. </strong></span></em>Freeze damage appears as darkened 
translucent or water-soaked areas that will deteriorate rapidly after thawing. Freeze damage can occur if round cabbages are stored below -0.9&deg;C (30.4&deg;F) and if Chinese cabbage is stored below -0.6&deg;C (31&deg;F).</p>

<p>Cabbages are sensitive to ethylene, which causes leaf abscission and leaf yellowing. Adequate ventilation during storage is important to maintain very low ethylene levels. Ethylene does not increase the disorder ""black speck"" or ""pepper spot"".
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmospheres (CA)</strong></span></p>

<p>Some benefit to shelf-life can be obtained with low O<sub>2</sub> (2.5-5%) and high CO<sub>2</sub> (2.5-6%) atmospheres at temperatures of 0-5&deg;C (32-41&deg;F). CA storage will maintain color and flavor of cabbage, retard root and stem growth, and reduce leaf abscission. O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres below 2.5% for round cabbage and 1% for Chinese cabbage will cause fermentation, and CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres &gt;10% will cause internal discoloration.</p>

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Physiological and Physical Disorders </strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Black speck.</strong></em> Black leaf speck (also called pepper spot, petiole spot, gomasho) is a disorder that consists of very small to moderate size discolored lesions on the midrib and veins of the leaves. The symptoms can occur after low temperatures in the field and by harvesting overmature heads, but are usually associated with transit and storage conditions. Low storage temperatures followed by warmer temperatures enhance development. Ethylene does not promote development of black speck in Chinese cabbage. Both round and Chinese cabbage cultivars vary widely in their susceptibility to this disorder. Storage with high CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres (10%) can reduce pepper spot development on round cabbage.<br /><br /><em><strong>Chilling injury.</strong></em> In Chinese cabbage is purported to occur during storage at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) after 3 months or longer. The main symptom is midrib discoloration, especially on outer leaves. Cultivars differ greatly in their susceptibility to develop midrib discoloration.<br /><br /><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Physical Injury. </strong></span></em
>Breakage of the midribs often occurs during field packing and causes increased browning and increased susceptibility to decay. Outer midribs of overmature heads will crack easily.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders </strong></span><br /><br />The most common decays found in stored cabbage are 
watery soft rot (<em>Sclerotinia</em>), gray mold rot (<em>Botrytis cinerea</em>), alternaria leaf spot (<em>Alternaria </em>spp.), and bacterial soft rot (caused by various bacterial species including <em>Erwinia</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Xanthomonas</em>). Bacterial soft-rots result in a slimy breakdown of the infected tissue, and may follow fungal infections. Trimming outer leaves, rapid cooling and low temperature storage reduce development of these rots, although <em>Botrytis</em> and <em>Alternaria</em> will grow at low storage temperatures.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br />Fresh-cut or shredded cabbage pieces brown during 
storage and atmospheres of 3-5% O<sub>2</sub> and 5-15% CO<sub>2</sub> retard discoloration. Too low oxygen levels lead to fermentation and package blow-up, especially if product is not held below 5&deg;C (41&deg;F).</p>

<ul>
<li>In practice, harvest decisions for carrots are based on several criteria depending on the market outlet or sales endpoint</li>
<li>Typically carrots are harvested at an immature state when the roots have achieved sufficient size to fill in the tip and develop a uniform taper</li>
<li>Length may be used as a maturity index for harvest timing of &lsquo;cut and peel' carrots to achieve a desired processing efficiency</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><br/><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>There are many visual and organoleptic properties that differentiate the diverse varieties of carrots for fresh market and minimal processing. In general, carrots should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firm (not flacid or limp)</li>
<li>Straight with a uniform taper from &lsquo;shoulder' to &lsquo;tip'</li>
<li>Bright orange</li>
<li>There should be little residual ""hairiness"" from lateral roots</li>
<li>No ""green shoulders"" or ""green core"" from exposure to sunlight during the growth phase</li>
<li>Low bitterness from terpenoid compounds</li>
<li>High moisture content and high reducing sugars are most desireable for fresh consumption</li>

<br/>
<p>Common storage conditions rarely achieve the optimum temperature for long- term storage to prevent decay, sprouting, and wilting. At storage temperatures of 3-5&deg;C, mature carrots can be stored with minimal decay for 3-5 months.<br /><br />Common &lsquo;Cello-pack' carrots are typically immature and may be stored successfully for 2-3 weeks at 3-5&deg;C. Bunched carrots are highly perishable due to the presence of the shoots (tops). Good quality is generally maintained only for 8-12 days, even with contact ice.<br /><br />Lighlty processed (fresh-cut, cut and peel) carrots typically maintain quality of 2-3 weeks at 3-5&deg;C.

<br /><strong><em>Intact Roots.</em></strong> Bruising, shatter-cracks and tip-breakage are signs of&nbsp; rough handling. Nantes-type carrots are particularly susceptible. Sprouting will continue as carrot roots develop new shoots after harvest. This is one reason low temperature postharvest management is critical. Common associated disorders include wilting, shriveling, or rubberiness due to dessication. White Root is a physiologic disorder due to suboptimal production conditions which results in patchy or streaks of low color on the carrot roots.<br /><br /><strong><em>Intact or Fresh-cut.</em></strong> Bitterness may be caused by preharvest stress (improper irrigation scheduling) or exposure to ethylene from ripening rooms or mixing with commodities such as apples. Freezing injury will likely result at temperatures of -1.2&deg;C ( 29.5&deg;F) or lower. Frozen carrots generally exhibit an outer ring of water-soaked tissue, viewed in cross section, which blackens in 2-3 days.<br /><br /><strong><em>Fresh-cut.</em></strong> White Blush, due to dehydration of cut or abrasion-peeled surfaces, has been a problem on fresh-cut carrots. Sharp cutting blades and residual free-moisture on the surface of the processed carrots will significantly delay the development of the disorder.

Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

The most prominent postharvest disease concerns are Gray Mold (<em>Botrytis</em> rot) Watery Rot (<em>Sclerotinia</em> rot), <em>Rhizopus</em> rot, Bacterial Soft Rot, induced by <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. <em>carotovora</em> and Sour Rot (<em>Geotrichum</em> rot). Proper handling and low temperature storage and transportation conditions are the best methods to minimize losses.

<p>Cauliflowers are selected for size and compactness of the head or curd. Mature curds are at least 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter. Loose or protruding floral parts, creating a &lsquo;ricy&rsquo; appearance, are a sign of overmaturity. Cauliflower is packaged after being closely trimmed into single layer cartons of 12 to 24 heads, with 12&rsquo;s most common.<br /><br />Cauliflower is primarily marketed with closely trimmed leaves and overwrapped with perforated film. Overwraps should provide four to six 1/4-inch holes per head to allow adequate ventilation.

<p>Cauliflower is highly sensitive to exogenous ethylene. Discoloration of the curd and&nbsp; accelerated yellowing and detachment of wrapper leaf stalks will result from low levels of ethylene during distribution and short-term storage. Do not mix loads such as apples, melons and tomatoes with cauliflower.

Responses to Controlled Atmosphere (CA)</strong></span></p>

<p>Controlled or modified atmospheres offer moderate to little benefit to cauliflower. Injury from low O<sub>2</sub> (&lt;2%) or elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (&gt;5%) may not be visual and will only be evident after cooking. When the curds become grayish, extremely soft, and emit strong off-odor. Higher levels (&gt;10%) of CO<sub>2</sub> will induce this injury within 48 hours. Combined low O<sub>2</sub> and slightly elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels (3-5%) delay leaf yellowing and the onset of curd browning by a few days.</p>

<p>Celery is harvested when the overall field reaches the desired marketable size and before the outer petioles develop ""pithiness"" (see Pith Breakdown below). Celery has very uniform crop growth and fields are harvested only once and stalks are packed by size after trimming outer petioles and leaves.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>High quality celery consists of stalks which are well formed, have thick petioles, are compact (not significantly bowed or bulging), have minimal petiole twisting, and have a light green and fresh appearance. Additional quality indices are stalk and midrib length, freedom from defects such as blackheart, pithy petioles, seedstalks, cracks or splits, and freedom from insect damage and decay.<br /><br />U.S. Grades: Extra No. 1; No. 1; No. 2 (Grade Standards established 1957)<br />Celery may be sold as ""Unclassified"" to designate a lot which has not been graded within U.S. standards.</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature </strong></span></p>

<p>0&deg;C (32&deg;F)</p>
<p>At optimum conditions, celery should have good quality after storage up to 5 to 7 weeks. Commonly, celery is rapidly pre-cooled and then stored at 0 to 2&deg;C (32 to 36&deg;F). If storage is intended to be less than one month, storing celery at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) is not recommended for more than 2 weeks in order to maintain good visual and sensory quality. Some continued growth of inner stalks will occur postharvest at temperatures &gt;0&deg;C (32&deg;F).

<strong>Blackheart.</strong></em> Internal leaves develop a brown discoloration which eventually becomes deep black. The cause is similar to tip-burn of lettuce or blossom-end rot of tomato. Although many predisposing factors may be involved, water-stress results in a calcium deficiency disorder causing cell death. <br /><br /><em><strong>Brown Checking.</strong></em> Splits, primarily along the inner surface of the petioles result from boron deficiency. <br /><br /><em><strong>Freezing Injury.</strong></em> Freezing injury will be initiated at -0.5&deg;C (31.1&deg;F). Symptoms of freezing injury include a watersoaked appearance on thawing and wilted leaves. Mild freezing causes pitting or short streaks in the petiole which develop a brown discoloration with additional storage.<br /><br /><em><strong>Pith Breakdown.</strong></em> The breakdown of the internal tissue of the petiole, the pith, is often refereed to as ""pithiness"" or pithy stems. The aerenchyma tissue of the petiole becomes white, spongy or vacuolated, and appears dry. Pith breakdown is induced by several factors that result in the induction of senescence, including cold stress, water stress, pre-bolting changes (seed stalk induction), and root infections. Pith breakdown will develop after harvest, but slowly under proper storage conditions. <br /><br /><em><strong>Crushing or cracking.</strong></em> Common and leads to rapid browning and decay.

<p>Chiles should be cooled as soon as possible to reduce water loss. Chile peppers are not as chilling sensitive as bell peppers. Chile peppers stored above 7.5&deg;C (45&deg;F) suffer more water loss, shrivel, color change and decay. Storage at 7.5&deg;C (45&deg;F) is considered the best for maximum shelf-life (3-5 weeks). Chiles can be stored at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) for at least 2 weeks without visible signs of chilling injury. Storage at 5&deg;C reduces water loss and shrivel, but after 2-3 weeks, chilling injury is mostly detected as discoloration of the seeds. Symptoms of chilling injury include pitting, decay, discoloration of the seed cavity, and excessive softening. Ripe or colored chiles are less chilling sensitive than mature-green chiles.

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Rates of Ethylene Production</strong></span></p>

<p>Some chiles such as jalape&ntilde;os show a nonclimacteric physiology during color change and produce very low levels of ethylene: 0.1-0.2 &micro;l/kg&bull;hr at 20-25&deg;C (68-77&deg;F). Other chiles such as Habaneros show increases in ethylene production during ripening and may produce over 1 &micro;l/kg&bull;hr at 20-25&deg;C (68-77&deg;F).
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Ethylene</strong></span></p>

<p>Responses to ethylene depend on the particular variety of chile. Chile poblanos for example may respond to ethylene treatment, while Jalape&ntilde;o peppers do not. As with bell peppers, holding partially colored chile peppers at warmer temperatures of 20-25&deg;C (68-77&deg;F) with high humidity (&gt;95%) is effective to complete color development. Adding ethylene may further enhance ripening but response is variety dependent.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmospheres (CA)</strong></span></p>

<p>At recommended storage temperature (7-8&deg;C), controlled and modified atmospheres of 3-5% O<sub>2</sub> in combination with 0-5% CO<sub>2</sub> are considered to provide only slight benefit to chile peppers. Low O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres may retard color development. High CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres (&gt;5%) can damage mature-green chiles (pitting, discoloration, softening), while colored (fully ripe) chiles are more tolerant of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<strong>Blossom end rot.</strong></em> This disorder occurs as a slight discoloration or a severe dark sunken lesion at or near the blossom end; it is caused by temporary insufficiencies of calcium due to water stress and may occur under high temperature conditions when the peppers are rapidly growing.<br /><br /><em><strong>Chilling injury. </strong></em>Symptoms of chilling injury include surface pitting, water-soaked areas, decay (especially <em>Alternaria</em>), and discoloration of the seed cavity.

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

Common decay causing organisms are <em>Botrytis</em>, <em>Alternaria</em>, and soft rots of fungal and bacterial origin.<br /><br /><em><strong>Botrytis or Grey mold.</strong></em> A common decay-causing organism on chile peppers; field sanitation and prevention of wounds on the fruit help reduce its incidence. Botrytis will grow well at the recommended storage temperatures. Hot water dips of peppers can effectively control botrytis rot (55&deg;C [130&deg;F] water for 4 minutes) without causing fruit injury.<br /><br /><em><strong>Bacterial Soft Rot. </strong></em>Soft rotting areas can be caused by several bacteria which attack damaged tissue; soft rots can also be common on washed or hydrocooled chile peppers where water sanitation was deficient.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Other Common Postharvest Defects</strong></span><br /><br />Mechanical damage (crushing, stem punctures, 
scrapes, etc.) is common on chile peppers; physical injury not only detracts from the visual quality of the chiles but also causes increased weight loss and decay.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br />The pungency or hotness of chile peppers is due to 
capsaicinoids (capsaicin is the main one) and hotness varies depending on the cultivar or genetics of the chile peppers. Environmental factors and maturity of the chiles also affects the capsaicin concentrations. Chiles that are stored under a range of temperatures and are still of marketable quality maintain their capsaicin concentrations.<br />For U.S. markets, corking (corky striations on the fruit surface) is considered unattractive. However in other markets, corking is a recognized characteristic of certain cultivars and is usually associated with jalape&ntilde;o chiles that are prepared in oil and vinegar as a side dish.</p>

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>General Information</strong></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Sweet corn postharvest expectations have changed dramatically with the increased availability and popularity of super sweet varieties based on the shrunken-2 gene (sh-2) and other naturally-occurring sweetness enhancing mutations. Although there is no relation to sweetness, regional consumer perceptions and preferences for kernel color have also caused significant shifts from traditional yellow corn to white and bicolor corn.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Sweet corn is considered mature for fresh market consumption or ""baby kernel"" processing when the pollination silks are dried and the kernels are still immature. The husk leaves remain tight and have a good green appearance. The ear is firm and turgid. The kernels are plump and appear 'milky', and not doughy, when squeezed. At this point the kernels of standard 'sugary' corn are 70-75% water content and kernels of sh-2 corn are at 77-78% water content. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Quality of fresh market sweet corn is judged by its fresh, uniform appearance, uniform and well filled rows, plumpness of kernels, milky kernel contents, and freedom from damage and defects (discoloration, harvest injury, worm damage, live insects, decaying silks or kernels). Trimmed, husked, or minimally processed whole-ears (i.e. microwave consumer packs) have additional grade standards for husk cover, husk appearance, length, and other quality indicators.<br /><br />U.S. Grades are Fancy, Fancy-Husked, No. 1, No. 1-Husked, and No. 2 (effective Feb. 12, 1992)</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature</strong></span></p>

<p>0&deg;C-1.5&deg;C (32&deg;F-34&deg;F)<br /><br />Typically iced. Standard sweet corn is not stored for more than a few days due to the rapid deterioration of quality, even at ideal temperatures. When short-term storage is necessary for orderly marketing, the maximum duration including transit times should not exceed 7 days. Super sweet corn has been stored at 0&deg;C for up to 21 days with generally acceptable market quality.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Relative Humidity</strong></span></p>

<p>95-98%
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Cooling and Top Icing</strong></span></p>

<p>Rapid removal of field heat and continuous and proper refrigeration are essential to the maintenance of sweet corn quality. Sweet corn is generally hydrocooled and packed with ice and/or top-iced. After thorough cooling and icing, storage and transit temperatures are held slightly above 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) to prevent freezing of the ice layer and ""capping-off"" of the container, which could reduce proper air circulation. Handling in bulk containers should be avoided unless provisions for generous and uniform icing can be assured.

<p>Exogenous ethylene is not considered an important postharvest handling factor. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmospheres</strong></span></p>

<p>Controlled or modified atmosphere storage or shipping offer moderate benefits to sweet corn quality maintenance. Low O<sub>2</sub> levels (3%) and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (10%) delay loss of sucrose content and maintain appearance of husks. CA at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) is superior to storage in air alone, but sugar content is not retain-ed as well as corn stored at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F). Sweet corn does not tolerate low 2 (&lt;2%) or elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (greater than or equal to 20%).</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Physiological and Physical Disorders</strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Freezing Injury</strong></em>. Freezing injury will be initiated at -0.6&deg;C (31&deg;F). Symptoms of freezing injury include watersoaked patches on the husks and watersoaked kernels becoming gelatinous and developing off-odors over time. <br /><br />Fresh market harvesting should be done by hand. Ears are snapped downward and away from the main stalk. Stalk ends are trimmed short to prevent excessive moisture loss. 

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

Diseases are not an important source of postharvest loss as compared to field acquired insect damage and physiological deterioration due to the high rate of respiration and conversion of sugars to starch. Dry silks often develop superficial molds after longer storage (greater than 10 days). 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br />Minimally processed frozen sweet corn may have better 
quality when the super sweet (sh-2) genotype is used rather than the typical sweet (su) genotype. Blanching prior to freezing is a common commercial and home consumer practice that may be minimized for super sweet varieties due to lower activity of enzymes which cause flavor changes. UC Davis research has shown that super sweet varieties typically require a 4 min blanch while sweet corn varieties require 6 or more minutes for corn-on-the-cob. Research done by both the USDA and UC Davis shows that during frozen storage of super sweet corn, sucrose increased and reducing sugars decreased in unblanched super sweet corn. After frozen storage for 8-9 months, sensory panels preferred blanched rather than unblanched super sweet corn.</p>

<p>Eggplant fruit have a moderate to high sensitivity to exogenous ethylene. Calyx abscission and increased deterioration, particularly browning, may be a problem if eggplants are exposed to &gt;1ppm ethylene during distribution and short-term storage.

Responses to Controlled Atmospheres (CA)</strong></span></p>

<p>Controlled or modified atmosphere storage or shipping offer little benefit to eggplant quality maintenance. Low O<sub>2</sub> levels (3-5%) delay deterioration and the onset of decay by a few days. Eggplant tolerates up to 10% CO<sub>2</sub> but storage life is not extended beyond the benefit of reduced levels of O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Freezing Injury.</strong></em> Freezing injury will be initiated at -0.8&deg;C (30.6&deg;F), depending on the soluble solids content. Symptoms of freezing injury include a watersoaked pulp becoming brown and desiccated in appearance over time. <br /><br />Harvesting should be done by cutting the calyx-stem free from the plant rather than by tearing. Cotton gloves are often used.<br /><br />Bruising and compression injury are very common when attention to careful harvest and handling practices are not followed. Eggplant cannot withstand stacking in bulk containers. 

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

Diseases are an important source of postharvest loss, particularly in combination with chilling stress. Common fungal pathogens are <em>Alternaria</em> (Black Mold Rot), <em>Botrytis</em> (Gray Mold Rot), <em>Rhizopus</em> (Hairy Rot), and <em>Phomopsis</em> Rot. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br />Rapid cooling, primarily to reduce water loss, soon 
after harvest is essential for optimal postharvest keeping quality. The precooling endpoint is typically 10&deg;C (50&deg;F). Forced-air cooling is the most effective practice. Room cooling after washing or hydrocooling is the most common practice. Moistened paper or waxed cartons are often used to reduce water loss. Japanese eggplants lose water 3 times more rapidly than American-type eggplants. Visible signs of water loss are reduction of surface sheen, skin wrinkling, spongy flesh, and browning of the calyx.<br /><br />Chilling injury and water loss can be reduced by storing of eggplant in polyethylene bags or polymeric film overwraps. Increased decay from Botrytis is a potential risk of this practice.</p>

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Garlic can be harvested at different stages of development for specialty markets, but most garlic is harvested when the bulbs are well mature. Harvest occurs after the tops have fallen and are very dry.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>High quality garlic bulbs are clean, white (or other colors typical of the variety), and well cured (dried neck and outer skins). The cloves should be firm to the touch. Cloves from mature bulbs should have a high dry weight and soluble solids content (&gt;35% in both cases).<br /><br />Grades include U.S. No. 1 and unclassified, and are based primarily on external appearance and freedom from defects. Minimum diameter for fresh market is about 4 cm (1.5 inches).</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature</strong></span></p>

<p>-1&deg;C to 0&deg;C (30&deg;F-32&deg;F). The variety of garlic affects potential storage life, and the recommended conditions for commercial storage depend on the expected storage period. Garlic can be kept in good condition for 1-2 months at ambient temperatures (20&deg;C-30&deg;C [68&deg;F-86&deg;F]) under low relative humidity (&lt;75%). However under these conditions, bulbs will eventually become soft, spongy and shriveled due to water loss. For long-term storage, garlic is best maintained at temperatures of -1&deg;C to 0&deg;C (30&deg;F-32&deg;F) with low relative humidity (60-70%). Good airflow is also necessary to prevent any moisture accumilation. Under these conditions garlic can be stored for more than 9 months.</p>
<p>Garlic will eventually lose dormancy, signaled by internal development of the sprout. This occurs most rapidly at intermediate storage temperatures of 5&deg;C-18&deg;C (41&deg;F-65&deg;F). Garlic odor is easily transferred to other products and should be stored separately. High humidity in the storages will favor mold growth and rooting. Mold growth can also be problematic if the garlic has not been well cured before storing.

<p>Atmospheres with high CO<sub>2</sub> (5-15%) are beneficial in retarding sprout development and decay during storage at 0-5&deg;C.

<p><em><strong>Freeze injury.</strong></em> Due to its high solids content, garlic freezes at temperatures below -1&deg;C (30&deg;F).<br /><br /><em><strong>Waxy breakdown</strong></em>. A physiological disorder that affects garlic during latter stages of growth and is often associated with periods of high temperature near harvest. Early symptoms are small, light yellow areas in the clove flesh that darken to yellow or amber with time. Finally the clove is translucent, sticky and waxy, but the outer dry skins are not usually affected. Waxy breakdown is commonly found in stored and shipped garlic but rarely in the field. Low oxygen levels and inadequate ventilation during handling and storage may also contribute to development of waxy breakdown.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders </strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Penicillium rot.</strong> </em>(<em>
Pencillium corymbiferum</em> and other spp.) Are common problems in stored garlic. Affected garlic bulbs may show little external evidence until decay is advanced. Affected bulbs are light in weight and the individual cloves are soft and spongy and powdery dry. In an advanced stage of decay, the cloves break down in a green or gray powdery mass. Low humidity in storage retards rot development. Less common storage decay problems include Fusarium basal rot (<em>Fusarium oxysporum cepae</em>) which infects the stem plate and causes shattering of the cloves, dry rot due to <em>Botrytis</em> <em>allii</em>, and bacterial rots (<em>Erwinia</em> spp., <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp.).
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br />To control sprout development and lengthen the storage 
period, garlic may be treated with preharvest applications of sprout inhibitors (i.e., maleic hydrazide) or be irradiated after harvest. Outer cloves of bulbs are easily damaged during mechanical harvest and these damaged areas discolor and decay during storage. Therefore high quality garlic for the fresh market is usually harvested manually to avoid mechanical damage.<br /><br />Curing garlic is the process by which the outer leaf sheaths and neck tissues of the bulb are dried. Warm temperatures, low relative humidity, and good airflow are conditions needed for efficient curing. Under favorable climatic conditions in California, the garlic is usually cured in the field. Curing is essential to obtain maximize storage life and have minimal decay.<br /><br />Garlic flavor is due to the formation of organosulfur compounds when the main odorless precursor alliin is converted by the enzyme alliinase to allicin and other flavor compounds. This occurs at low rates unless the garlic cloves are crushed or damaged. Alliin content decreases during storage of garlic bulbs, but the effect of time, storage temperatures and atmospheres has not yet been well documented.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Fresh culinary herbs are variable in botanical origin and in their postharvest properties. This summary is useful for the following fresh herbs: basil, chervil, chives, cilantro, dill, epazote, mache, marjoram, mint, mitsuba, oregano, parsley, sage, shiso, tarragon and thyme.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Many culinary herbs are harvested as soft or semi-woody leafy stems (dill, oregano, tarragon, basil, mint), and the herb can also include immature or mature flowers. Some herbs are harvested as developing leaves (mache) or intact plants (cilantro, parsley). 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Quality characteristics are largely visual and include appearance of freshness, uniformity of size, form and color, and lack of defects (damaged or yellowed leaves, decay, insect damage, wilting). Characteristic aroma is essential for culinary herb quality, and generally essential oils and aroma decrease during storage.</p>

<p>For most herbs, storage at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) is required to optimize quality and storage life. Expected shelf-life is 3 weeks at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) and 2 weeks at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F). See table for specific data on different fresh herbs. Basil and shiso are chilling sensitive and should be stored above 10&deg;C (50&deg;F). Depending on water loss, a shelf-life of 1 to 2 weeks can be expected for basil and shiso. Herbs may be cooled by hydrocooling before packaging or room cooling after packaging. Some herbs such as cilantro and parsley are iced, and some herbs may be vacuum cooled. Because of the small quantities marketed, water loss can be a serious cause of quality loss, especially in the large-leaved herbs such as basil and cilantro.<br /><br />Effect of temperature with high humidity on the visual quality of fresh culinary herbs stored for 10 days. Visual quality was scored on a 9 to 1 scale, where 9 = excellent, 7 = good, 5 = fair, 3 = poor, 1 = unuseable.

<p>Some benefit to shelf-life can be obtained with low O<sub>2</sub> (1-5%) and high CO<sub>2</sub> (5-15%) atmospheres at moderate temperatures 5-10&deg;C (41-50&deg;F). Low O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres will reduce respiration rates and reduce the detrimental effects of ethylene.

Chilling symptoms include browning of the leaves and growing tip, bronzing of the leaf veins, and loss of the glossy appearance of the leaves. The figure below shows the time need to have visible chilling symptoms when basil is stored at different temperatures.</p>

A score of 3 was considered the limit for commercial acceptability (A score of 0 = no injury, 8 = severe injury).&nbsp; </span><br /><br />Damage to the herb leaves at harvest can lead to discoloration and increased susceptibility to decay.&nbsp; 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders </strong></span><br /><br />Fresh culinary herbs can be attacked by the same 
bacteria and fungi that infect other leafy green products. Bacterial soft-rots are caused by numerous bacteria species and result in a slimy breakdown of the infected tissue. Soft-rots may follow fungal infections. Trimming older leaves, rapid cooling and low temperature storage reduce development of bacterial soft-rots. Water spraying at retail may favor bacterial growth. Fungal pathogens may also lead to a watery breakdown of herb tissues (watery soft-rot caused by Sclerotinia for example) but are distinguished from bacterial soft-rots by the development of spores. Gray mold rot caused by <em>Botrytis cinerea</em> can occur commonly on basil and shiso. Trimming and low temperatures also reduce the severity of these rots.&nbsp; 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br />Because of the importance of the essential oils and 
aroma to fresh culinary herb quality, it is important to emphasize that visual shelf-life is much longer than useful culinary shelf-life. For example, in cilantro, aroma notably declines after 10 days, although cilantro can be marketable for 21 days under some storage conditions. In basil, storage at chilling temperatures greatly reduces aroma quality.</p>

<p>Jicama (<em>Pachyrhizus erosus</em>) is a warm season legume root crop. It is also called Yam Bean and is a brown skinned turnip-shaped root eaten raw or cooked. Jicama roots can be harvested at various stages of development. Young tender roots (100-150 g) harvested from green plants are found in specialty markets. Fully mature roots, however, weigh from 250-1500 g. Mature roots are characterized by their size and well-developed periderm as well as their starchy-sweet flavor. To favor hardening of the periderm, plant tops are removed mechanically or irrigation is stopped.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Good quality jicama roots should be smooth and firm, with uniform shape and size, be free from mechanical damage to the skin, and have a crisp, succulent, white sweet-starchy flesh. There are no U.S. Grades for jicama. In Hawaii, however, two grades are recognized based on size and freedom from defects (dirt, discoloration, growth cracks, roughness, insect damage, mechanical injury).</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature</strong></span></p>

<p>The recommended conditions for commercial storage of jicama are to keep roots cool and dry. Jicama roots are very chilling sensitive and roots should be stored at 12.5&deg;C to 15&deg;C (55&deg;F to 59&deg;F) with moderate relative humidity (70-80%). A storage life of 2-4 months can be expected under these conditions, although stem sprouts will develop after about 2 months. Sprout development results in weight loss and especially a loss of juiciness of the pulp. Minimizing mechanical damage to the periderm during harvest will reduce decay incidence during storage.

temperatures of 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) or below. Depending on variety and production conditions, roots may develop symptoms of chilling injury in 1 to 3 weeks of storage at 10&deg;C (50&deg;F). No chilling injury is observed on roots stored at 12.5&deg;C (55&deg;F). Decay is the main external symptom of chilling injury, and discoloration and loss of crisp texture are the main internal symptoms. The roots eventually become ""rubbery"" in texture when severely chilled. Internal discoloration typically occurs from the skin inwards and is more common and more severe in moderately chilled roots (stored at 10&deg;C). At lower temperatures, the pulp will take on a translucent appearance but not necessarily develop brown discoloration; these roots probably also exhibit external decay.

Leaves with tipburn are unsightly and the damaged leaf margins are weaker and susceptible to decay.<br /><br /><em><strong>Russet Spotting.</strong></em> A common disorder due to exposure to low concentrations of ethylene which stimulates the production of phenolic compounds which lead to brown pigments. Russet spots appear as dark brown spots especially on the midribs. Under severe conditions, russet spots are found on the green leaf tissue and throughout the head. The disorder is strictly cosmetic but makes the lettuce unmarketable. Ethylene contamination may occur from propane fork lifts, transport in mixed loads, or storage with ethylene-generating fruits such as apples, pears and peaches.<br /><br /><em><strong>Brown Stain.</strong></em> The symptoms of this disorder are yellowish-reddish-brown large, depressed spots on the midribs mostly. These may darken or enlarge with time. Brown stain also appears as reddish-brown streaks in some cases. Brown stain is caused by exposure to above 3% CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres, especially at low temperatures.<br /><br /><em><strong>Pink rib.</strong></em> A disorder in which the midribs take on a pinkish coloration. Overmature heads and high storage temperatures increase the disorder. Ethylene exposure does not increase the disorder and low O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres do not control it. <br /><br />Breakage of the midribs often occurs during field packing and causes increased browning and increased susceptibility to decay.

<p>Extended storage (~12-15 days) in 3% O<sub>2</sub> and 10% CO<sub>2</sub> at 0&deg;C has been controlled demonstrated. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> at 10-15% (typically 10%) in air is beneficial in Atmosphere (CA) preventing decay and reducing the rate of blackening of the stipe and gills. The beneficial effect is most pronounced if temperatures cannot be maintained below 5&deg;C (41&deg;F). Short exposure to higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (20%) is safe and beneficial only if temperatures can be maintained at 0&deg;C-1&deg;C (32&deg;F-34&deg;F).<br /><br />Improper control of controlled atmospheres or improper packaging can rapidly lead to depletion of oxygen resulting in conditions favorable for<em> Clostridium botulinum</em>. For this reason, primarily, the use of CA and MA is not common.</p>

<p>Cactus stems or ""nopalitos"" (in Spanish) are the rapidly-growing succulent stems of the Prickly Pear Cactus (<em>Opuntia</em> spp). They are grown in California as a specialty vegetable or imported from Mexico, where they are a traditional vegetable. Cactus stems are harvested based on size, and can be harvested small</p>

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Quality Indices</strong></span></p>
<p>Good quality nopalitos are fresh, turgid and a brilliant green color. Nopalitos should be harvested when young and tender and not early in the morning to avoid a high acid content (see special considerations).</p>

<p>Generally nopalitos should be cooled to about 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) to reduce loss of visual appearance due to water loss. The recommended conditions for storage of nopalitos are 5&deg;C to 10&deg;C (41&deg;F to 50&deg;F) at high relative humidity. The major factors limiting storage life of nopalitos are decay and dehydration. Nopalitos stored under higher temperatures rapidly loss their brilliant shiny appearance, become dull green and may also begin to yellow and curve inward due to water loss.</p>

Nopalitos are chilling sensitive when stored below 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) . However, 3 weeks at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) may be needed to observe some chilling symptoms. Chilling damage may be manifested as a superficial bronzing or discoloration and increased susceptibility to decay. The onset of chilling injury will depend on storage temperature, maturity and source of product.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders </strong></span><br /><br />Decay at the cut stem end may be a problem if nopalitos 
are stored for longer than 2 weeks. Decay is usually avoided by insuring that the nopalitos have not been damaged when cut from the plant. Decay can also occur during storage at places where spines have penetrated the surface.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br />Cactus stems should be harvested and handled with care 
to avoid mechanical damage, especially due to spines from one stem penetrating the neighboring stem. Spine damage leads to a rusty-brown discoloration and pathological problems.<br /><br />Because of the spines, a cleaned and diced product is an attractive option. The cut nopalitos cannot be washed before marketing because it will cause mucilage to exude and increase discoloration of the cut surfaces. Cleaned and diced nopalitos should be stored between 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) and 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) and have a shelf-life of about 6 days.<br /><br />Because the prickly pear plant is a CAM plant (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) and fixes CO<sub>2</sub> at night as malic acid before converting it to sugars during the day, the acid content of nopalitos may fluctuate greatly and affect their flavor. Therefore it is recommended to harvest the stems after 2-3 hours of sunlight. Small nopalitos however, are not CAM-active. In addition, low storage temperatures 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) maintain acid levels.</p>

<p>Okra pods are immature fruits and are harvested when they are very rapidly growing. Harvest typically occurs 3 to 7 days after flowering. Okra should be harvested when the fruit is bright green, the pod is fleshy and seeds are small. After that period, the pod becomes pithy and tough, and the green color and mucilage content decrease.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Okra pods should be tender and not fibrous, and have a color typical of the cultivar (generally bright green). The pods should be well formed and straight, have a fresh appearance and not show signs of dehydration. Grade is U.S. no. 1. Pods are packed based on length with Fancy, Choice and Jumbo designations for size categories. Okra should be free of defects such as leaves, stems, broken pods, insect damage, and mechanical injury. The tender pods are easily damaged during harvest, especially on the ridges and this leads to unsightly brown and black discoloration. Quality losses that occur during marketing are often associated with mechanical damage, water loss, chilling injury, and decay.</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature</strong></span></p>

<p>7-10&deg;C (45-50&deg;F)</p>
<p>Very good quality can be maintained up to 7 to 10 days at these temperatures. If stored at higher temperatures, the pods lose quality due to dehydration, yellowing and decay. When stored at lower than recommended temperatures, chilling injury will be induced (see physiological disorders). Chilling symptoms include surface discoloration, pitting and decay. Okra can be successfully hydrocooled or forced-air cooled.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Optimum Relative Humidity</strong></span></p>

<p>Weight loss is very high in immature okra pods and cultivars may vary in rate of water loss. A very high relative humidity (95-100%) is needed to retard dehydration, pod toughening, and loss of fresh appearance.

<p>Maturity of green onions is determined primarily by size which is largely determined by seeding density. Green or ""bunching"" onions are selected varieties of white onion (<em>Allium cepa</em>) planted at high density or from the non-bulbing onion group (<em>Allium fistulosum</em>) generally called Japanese-bunching. Harvest maturity is generally accepted as mean diameter of 0.6 to 1.3 cm (1/4 to 1/2 inch) in diameter at the base plate of the immature bulb.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Quality green onions have a thin, white shank or neck at least 5 to 7.5 cm (2-3 inches) in length. Green onions should be well-formed (at most slightly curved or angular), uniform in shape, thin-necked, turgid, bright in color, well cleaned, and free from excessive roots, decay, insect-injury, mechanical damage, broken or crushed leaves, or dehydrated clipped-ends.<br /><br />U.S. Grade No. 1, No. 2 (Standards established June 1947)</p>

<p>0&deg;C (32&deg;F)<br /><br />Green onions held at 32&deg;F will remain fresh and flavorful for up to 4 weeks. Green onions are highly perishable and normally marketed over a short period. Lowering and removing the heat of respiration as well as preventing water loss is critical. Package-icing and perforated polyethylene film liners are used to maintain quality. Typically, storage life of green onions at 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) is 7 to 10 days. Higher temperatures greatly accelerate yellowing and decay of the leaves. Green onions benefit from light misting.</p>

<p>Information varies widely on the optimal conditions and extent of benefit of CA for green onions. In general, a controlled atmosphere of 2% oxygen with 5% carbon dioxide at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) should allow 6 to 8 weeks storage.

Freezing Injury.</strong></em> Freezing injury will be initiated at -1.0&deg;C (30.6&deg;F). Symptoms of freezing injury include a water-soaked appearance of bulb or leaves and wilted or gelatinous leaves, after thawing. The bulb will become soft or gelatinous in texture in outer tissue. Freeze-injury is rapidly followed by bacterial soft-rot decay.<br /><br /><em><strong>Curvature.</strong></em> Upward bending of young, elongating shoots will occur in horizontally packed green onions. Prompt cooling and storage at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) will largely prevent this defect. CA-packaging can further retard curvature (See Responses to CA).<br /><br />Harvesting, trimming, and banding should be done gently to prevent crushing or other injuries. At harvest, pulling is usually done without undercutting. Bunching is done in the field or in a packing shed. Bruising is common and leads to rapid decay when attention to rapid cooling (within 3 hours of harvest) and cold chain control are not applied.

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

Diseases may be an important source of postharvest loss in combination with rough handling and poor temperature control. Common diseases are Bacterial Soft-Rot (primarily <em>Erwinia carotovora </em>and <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp) and Grey Mold (<em>Botrytis cinerea</em>). Grey Mold is often associated with barely visible preharvest injury to tender foliage by chemical applications or ozone injury from air pollution.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Odor.</strong></em> Green onions produce 
odors that may be adsorbed by many other commodities such as apples, grapes, and mushrooms.<br /><br /><em><strong>Package-Ice.</strong></em> Used for transportation of green onions has been implicated on several occasions as the cause of outbreaks of food-borne illness due to the pathogens <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and others. Water quality and hygienic handling of ice is essential.<br /><br />Proper selection of packaging films together with proper temperature management can greatly extend the shelf-quality of green onions trimmed or prepared for bulk ready-to-use format.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Edible-Pod Peas include both Oriental or Asian (also Snow) flat type pods, harvested when the seeds are very small and immature, and the Snap or Sugar Snap Pea which resemble a typical fresh garden pea but with smaller seeds.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Snow Peas are selected for size and maximal recovery of bright green, flat pods with minimal seed enlargement. Older and yellowing pods are avoided by careful hand-harvesting.<br /><br />Sugar Snap Peas are selected in a similar manner but some degree of seed-pod filling is desirable. Larger seeds rapidly become starchy. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Edible-pod peas should be uniformly bright green (light to deep green but not yellow-green), fully turgid, clean, and free from damage (Thrip injury, broken pods). The stem and calyxes should be green and there should be very few blossoms attached to the pods.<br /><br />U.S. Grades: U.S. Fancy, and U.S. No. 1, (established in June 1942)<br />Standards for Fresh Peas apply to Snap Peas but not Oriental Peas</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature</strong></span></p>

<p>0&deg;C (32&deg;F)<br /><br />Edible-pod peas are highly perishable and will not maintain good quality for more than 2 weeks. Wilting, yellowing of pods, loss of tenderness, development of starchiness and decay are likely to increase following storage beyond 14 days; defects occur faster at common distribution conditions of 5 to 10&deg;C (41 to 50&deg;F).</p>

<p>Peas are moderately sensitive to exogenous ethylene. Accelerated yellowing and&nbsp; decay will result from extended exposure to low levels of ethylene during distribution and short-term storage. The calyx is more sensitive to ethylene than the pod. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>

<p>Reports vary widely in the benefit of CA for Sugar and Snap Peas. Atmospheres of 2 to 3% O<sub>2</sub> and 2 to 3% CO<sub>2</sub> are considered by UC Research to offer the best, but moderate, benefit to peas beyond that of rapid cooling and proper storage. Low O<sub>2</sub> may promote off-flavors and off-odors.

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

A variety of fungal pod-spotting and decay pathogens affect edible-pod peas. Common diseases include Chocolate Spot and Grey mold (<em>Botrytis cinerea</em>), Watery Soft Rot (<em>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</em>), Rhizopus Rot, and Ascochyta Pod Spot. Bacterial Soft Rot is common following rough handling or freezing injury. Surface decay can occur readily, on weak calyxes (brown at harvest) and on blossom remains. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br />Package-icing and top-icing loads may be used for Snow 
Peas but is typically detrimental to Snap Peas because surface moisture promotes decay. Improper CA/MA conditions in ready-to-cook vegetable medleys often leads to off-flavors and fungal decay (typically Botrytis grey mold) at the blossom-end of the pod.</p>

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices </strong></span></p>

<p>Immature potatoes, generally harvested in spring or early summer, have a thin, poorly developed periderm, or skin. Irrigation and planting bed management, along with the option of vine-killing treatments, manage harvest ""maturity"". Harvest preparedness generally begins once tubers have reached a desirable size for the variety or market. Immature potatoes are easily bruised and ""skinning"" leads to shriveling or decays. They are very perishable relative to late-crop potatoes and are only stored for short periods. Curing potatoes for 8 days at 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) and 95% RH will allow extended storage of up to 5 months at 4&deg;C (39&deg;F) and 95 to 98% RH, depending on variety. More typically, early-crop potatoes are harvested, cooled to 15&deg;C (59&deg;F), treated with a sprouting inhibitor, packed and shipped in a short period of time (i.e. 1 to 5 days).
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>High quality traits, in commercial trade, include more than 70 to 80% of tubers well shaped, brightness of color (esp. reds, yellows, and whites), uniformity, firmness, freedom from adhering soil, freedom from bruising (black spot or shatter-bruising), scuffing or skinning, growth cracks, sprouting, insect damage, Rhizoctonia Black Scurf, decay, greening, or other defects. Commercial standards in use are typically higher than USDA grade standards. Differentiation of quality for potatoes is very complex.<br /><br />U.S. Grades: Extra No. 1; No. 1; Commercial; No. 2 (Grade Standards established 1991) Potatoes may be sold as ""Unclassified"" to designate a lot, which has not been graded within the meaning of U.S. standards.</p>

<p>At optimum conditions, potatoes should have good quality after storage of 3 to 5 weeks. Storing immature potatoes below 10-13&deg;C (50-55&deg;F) for as few as 3 days may cause the accumulation of reducing sugars leading to excessive browning during frying/chipping. Storage for less than 3 weeks is recommended to maintain good visual and sensory quality of immature potatoes.

<p>Potato tubers are not very sensitive to external ethylene. Low levels of external ethylene have been shown to elevate respiration, especially in immature potatoes, and result in weight loss and mild shriveling. After aging for 2-3 months at temperatures above 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) and in the absence of sprouting inhibitor application, low levels of ethylene may retard sprouting. High concentrations of external ethylene may induce sprouting.

<p>Controlled or modified atmospheres offer little benefit to potato. Periderm development and wound healing is delayed at atmospheres below 5% O<sub>2</sub>. Injury from low O<sub>2</sub> Atmosphere (CA) (&lt;1.5%) or elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (&gt;10%) will induce off-odors, off-flavors, internal discoloration, and increased decay.</p>

Insufficient oxygen reaches the interior of the tuber under these conditions.<br /><br /><strong><em>Black Spot.</em></strong> Responsible for significant postharvest losses, particularly in response to over-fertilization with nitrogen, low soil potassium availability, irregular irrigation, and other pre-harvest practices. Non-pigmented compounds form in the vascular bundle tissue just under the skin during storage. Following severe bruising or cutting, the affected tuber tissue turns reddish, then blue becoming black in 24 to 72 hours. Severity increases with time.Varieties differ significantly in their susceptibility and symptom expression.<br /><br /><em><strong>Chilling Injury.</strong></em> Storage at temperatures near 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) for a few weeks may result in a mahogany discoloration of internal tissue in some varieties. Much longer periods of storage are generally required for chilling injury.<br /><br /><em><strong>Greening.</strong></em> Exposure to bright light during postharvest handling, or longer periods (1 to 2 weeks) of low light intensity, can result in the development of chlorophyll in the potato tuber, anatomically a modified stem. Associated with greening, bitter and toxic glycoalkaloids, such as solanine, are formed. Solanine also forms in response to bruising, wounding (including fresh processing followed by storage), and during sprouting. Glycoalkaloids are heat stable and minimally impacted by cooking.<br /><br /><em><strong>Internal Brown Spot. </strong></em>Internal dry, corky reddish-brown or black spots or sectors. Uneven water management and/or widely fluctuating temperatures induce this calcium uptake deficiency, usually early in tuber development. Uneven water availability may also result in Hollow Heart, a corky cavitation at the center of the tuber.<br /><br />Harvesting, packing and handling should be done with great care to prevent damage to the highly sensitive, thin-skinned, turgid tubers. Crushing, Pressure Bruising, Brown Spot or Shatter Bruising are common defects and may lead to rapid water loss, shriveling and decay.<br /><br /><strong><em>Brown Spot.</em></strong> Discoloration just beneath the inner surface of the tuber resulting from bruising or rough handling. See Black Spot.<br /><br /><strong><em>Freezing Injury.</em></strong> Freezing injury will be initiated at -0.8&deg;C (30.5&deg;F). Symptoms of freezing injury include a water-soaked appearance, glassiness, and tissue breakdown on thawing. Mild freezing may also result in chilling injury.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: #663300;"">Pathological Disorders</span></strong><br /><br />Diseases are an important source of postharvest loss, particularly in combination,with rough handling and poor temperature control. Three major bacterial diseases and a greater number of fungal pathogens are responsible for, occasionally, serious postharvest losses. The major bacterial and fungal pathogens that cause postharvest losses in transit, storage, and to the consumer are Bacterial Soft-Rot (<em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. <em>carotovora</em> and subsp. <em>atroseptica</em>), Ralstonia (ex <em>Pseudomonas</em>, ex <em>Burkholderi</em>) <em>solanacearum</em>,* Phytophthora infestans (late blight), Fusarium Rot (<em>Fusarium </em>spp.), Pink Rot (Phytophthora spp.), and Water rot (<em>Pythium</em> spp.) Occasionally serious diseases of immature tubers include Pink Eye (<em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>) and Grey Mold (<em>Botrytis cinerea</em>).</p>

<p>Corking of the stem and subtle changes in rind color (bright green to dull green in &lsquo;Kabocha&rsquo; for example, Photo 1, Photo 2) are the main external indications of maturity. Immature fruit have a fleshy stem, maturing fruit will have some stem corking, and well mature fruit will have a well corked stem.&nbsp; In winter squash, such as butternut, external color changes only slightly during maturation (Photo 3). Internal color should be intense and typical of the cultivar (Photo 4). The concentrations of the yellow and orange carotenoids generally increase only slightly during storage. Maturity at harvest is the major determinant of internal color. Immature fruit will be of inferior eating quality because they contain less stored carbohydrates (Photo 4). Immature fruit will have more decay and weight loss during storage than mature fruits.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Pumpkin and winter squash should be full sized and well formed with the stem intact. They should be well matured with good rind development typical of the cultivar. Internal quality attributes are high color due to a high carotenoid content, and high dry weight and sugar and starch contents (Photo 4).</p>

<p>12.5-15&deg;C (55-59&deg;F) <br /><br />Pumpkins and winter squash are very chilling sensitive when stored below 10&deg;C (50&deg;F). Depending on the cultivar a storage life of 2 to 6 months can be expected at 12.5-15&deg;C (55-59&deg;F). Research at Oregon State University showed that for 8 currently produced winter squash cultivars stored at 10-15&deg;C (50-59&deg;F), 90%, 70% and 50% were marketable after 9, 15 and 20 weeks, respectively. For green rind squashes, storing at 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) may cause degreening, undesirable yellowing, and texture loss. The green rind squashes can be stored at 10-12&deg;C (50-55&deg;F) to prevent degreening, although some chilling injury may occur at the lower temperature. High storage temperature (&gt;15&deg;C) will result in excessive weight loss, color loss and poor eating quality. In a UC Davis study, the best temperature for butternut squash storage for 7 months was 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) (Photo 5).&nbsp; Besides weight loss and browning and drying of damage areas, higher storage temperatures also lead to more rapid breakdown of pulp tissue (Photo 6).
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Optimum Relative Humidity</strong></span></p>

<p>50-70% with 60% usually considered optimum moderate relative humidity with&nbsp; good ventilation is essential for optimum storage. High humidity will promote decay. Although 50-70% R.H. will reduce decay during storage, significant weight loss will occur. For example, mature Kabocha squash lose 1.0 and 1.5% of their fresh weight per week of storage at 12.5&deg;C (59&deg;F) and 20&deg;C (68&deg;F), respectively.&nbsp;Weight loss of butternut squash stored at 12.5&deg;C and 20&deg;C was 2.5% and 5.5% per month, respectively.</p>

Responses to Ethylene</strong></span></p>

<p>Exposure to ethylene will degreen squash with green rinds. Ethylene will also cause abscission of the stem, especially in less mature fruit.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmosphere (CA)</strong></span></p>

<p>Atmospheres containing 7% CO<sub>2</sub> can be beneficial by reducing loss of green color. Yellow squash, however, appear not to be benefited by 5 or 10% CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres. Lowering the O<sub>2</sub> concentration does not appear to provide any benefit. Univ. of Georgia research showed that storing different pumpkin cultivars at 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) for 2-3 months in 3% O<sub>2</sub> + 5% CO<sub>2</sub> increased the percent of marketable fruit compared to pumpkins held at ambient conditions.</p>

Symptoms of chilling injury are sunken pits on the surface and high levels of decay once fruit are removed from storage. Storing fruit 1 month at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) is sufficient to cause chilling injury symptoms. Depending on the cultivar, storage for several months at 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) may cause some chilling injury (Photo 5). Changes in respiration rates will precede visible chilling injury symptoms (Photo 6).&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>Freezing injury.</strong></em> Can occur at temperatures below -0.8&deg;C (30.5&deg;F). 

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br /><p>Several fungi are associated with decay during storage of pumpkins and winter squashes (See Disorder Photos). <em>Fusarium</em>, <em>Pythium</em> and anthracnose (<em>Colletotrichum</em>) and gummy stem blight or black rot (Didymella) (Photo 7, Photo 8) are common fungi. Alternaria rot (Photo 9) will develop on chill-damaged winter squashes. Fruit that are overmature at harvest (&gt;2 weeks beyond optimal harvest date) will tend to have more storage decay. Rhizopus may develop rapidly on fruit that have been injured at harvest (Photo 10).</p>

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Curing. </strong></em>The fruits may have 
tender rinds when freshly harvested. Curing in the field, with protection from the sun (Photo 13) by placing under the leaves, before handling and stacking into bins or wagons will help to harden or cure the rind. The recommended storage conditions also favor curing or hardening of the rind.</p>

<p>Maturity is generally based on marketable size after threshold days beyond seed sowing has been reached (commonly 75 to 85 days). Some varieties transition from green to red or red-purple leaves at maturity or the onset of cool weather. Head-forming radicchio are firm and compact at maturity. Leaf raddichio have a long conical shape similar to Romaine lettuce. Radicchio should be harvested with a small stub of root remaining to help retain leaf attachment.

<p>Radish (<em>Raphanus sativus</em> L.) is a diversely formed root vegetable and has many uses worldwide. Red and icicle radish are most common but Asian ""daikon"" types are increasing in popularity outside of countries such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China. The number of days post-seeding or emergence, which may vary from 30 to 70 days, depending on type, typically determines maturity. A minimum size standard for common red radish is 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) equatorial diameter. Current crop management practices stress rapid growth to ensure a mild flavor and crisp texture. Fertilization and irrigation management, or environmental conditions that slow growth may result in a woody texture and high pungency. Over-mature radish tends to be pithy (vacuolated) or spongy in texture and may develop harsh flavors, for most palates.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Roots of Bunched or Topped Common Red Radish should, ideally, be of uniform and similar shape for the variety, well formed, smooth, firm but of tender texture, and free of growth or harvest damage, and free of decay, disease or insects. Bunched radish tops should be fresh in appearance, turgid, and free of freeze injury or other serious injury, seed stalk, yellowing or other discoloration, disease, decay, or insects.<br /><br />U.S. Grade Standards effective October 1968 includes U.S. No. 1 and Commercial</p>

<p>Rapid cooling is essential to achieve the full storage potential of seed sprouts. Under these conditions most sprouts may be expected to maintain acceptable quality for 5 to 9 days. Shelf-life at 2.5&deg;C (36&deg;F) is less than 5 days, at 5&deg;C (41&deg;F), and at 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) is less than 2 days. The high respiration rates and perishable nature demand distribution and short-term storage at 0&deg;C (32&deg;F). Although industry experiences with Mung Bean suggest the potential for damage, no symptoms of chilling injury have been unequivocally linked to this temperature regime.

Pathological Disorders </strong></span><br /><br />Bacterial Decay (<em>Pantoea agglomerans = Erwinia 
herbicola, Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> Biovar II, <em>Pseudomonas marginalis, Pseudomonas viridiflava</em>) is a common problem in many sprout types and will develop very rapidly in production systems as well as in postharvest storage, at warmer than optimum temperatures. High quality seed, proper pre-germination, seed treatments and postharvest refrigeration are the primary controls but washing sprouts in chlorinated or ozonated water (or other effective and approved disinfectant) will help control this decay and spoilage.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Microbial Food Safety and Sanitation. </strong></em>Several types of seed sprouts have been clinically linked to several notable outbreaks of bacterial pathogens, especially in recent years. Multistate incidents of highly virulent Salmonella and enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 have been traced to the consumption of alfalfa, Mung bean, and possibly radish sprouts. Seed contamination has been positively identified as, at least, one confirmed source of contamination in several cases.<br /><br />In 1998, the California Department of Health Services led a petition for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Section 18 registration of a 2% Ca(OCl)<sub>2</sub> treatment for alfalfa seed as the best available method to ensure elimination of pathogens from seed. Full EPA Section 3 registration is expected in 2000. The International Sprout Growers association has endorsed this treatment as a voluntary industry-wide standard.<br /><br />Organic sprout growers are at risk of losing their organic certification due to above limit residuals of hypochlorite. Alternative treatments are being actively investigated.</p>

<p>Summer squashes (soft-rind) are consumed at a range of physiological maturities but are defined as immature fruits of the diverse Cucurbitaceae family. Depending on cultivar and temperature, the time from flowering to harvest may be 45 to 60 days for zucchini, yellow straightneck or crookneck, and scallop (Patty Pan-type) squash and 75 days or more for many of the Sponge squash (immature gourds) such as Luffa. Fruit may be harvested at a very immature stage, at the desired fruit size, before seeds begin to enlarge and harden. A thin, soft external rind and external glossiness are also indicators of a pre-maturity condition. The entire fruit is edible, either raw or cooked, without removal of seeds and seed cavity tissue. Small, young fruit are tender and generally have a slightly sweet taste. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Summer squash quality is based on uniform shape, tenderness of rind and internal tissue, overall firmness, a glossy skin color, and an intact well-trimmed stem portion. Uniformity of shape is an important quality factor and is defined to be characteristic of the type or variety, and free of twisting, groves, or other disproportionate growth defects. Size is not part of the United States Standard for grades but may be contractually specified as minimum or maximum diameter or length or both. Additional quality indices are freedom from growth or handling defects (discoloration, cuts bruises, abrasions, pitting) freedom from decay, and an absence of yellowing on dark green varieties.</p>
<p>U.S. Grades are No. 1 and No. 2 (effective Jan. 6, 1984)</p>

A poorly trimmed stem-end is a quality defect because it promotes decay.<br /><br /><strong><em>Bruising, scuffing, and compression injury</em></strong> are very common when attention to careful harvest and gentle handling practices are not followed. <br /><br /><span style=""color: #000000;""><em><strong>Dehydration</strong></em></span>. Water loss is a serious and common postharvest problem for summer squash.

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

Diseases are an important source of postharvest loss, particularly in combination with physical injury or chilling stress. A large list of bacterial and fungal pathogens cause postharvest losses in transit, storage, and to the consumer. <em>Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum</em> spp. (Anthracnose), Bacterial Rots, Cladosporium Scab, Pythium Cottony Leak, Didymella Black Rot, and Rhizopus Soft Rot are common disorders on summer squash. 
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br />Summer squash are often treated with approved waxes or 
oils to reduce water loss, reduce abrasion injury and enhance appearance.<br /><br />Included in the broad group of summer squash, are zucchini, cizelle, chayote, scallopini, yellow straightneck and crookneck, cucuza, Patty Pan, cocozelle, and marrow squash. Zucchini are considered the most chilling tolerant. Other types may maintain quality best during storage periods of 10-14 days at at slightly warmer temperatures (7.2&deg;C (45&deg;F)); 95% R.H. The relative susceptibility of summer squash varieties (green, yellow, crookneck and scalloped) to chilling injury is shown below.

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>General Information</strong></span></p>

<p>The sweet potato (<em>Ipomoea batatas</em>) is a warm season root crop. Moist, sweet flesh types of sweetpotatoes are sometimes called ""yams"", but these should not be confused with true yams (<em>Dioscorea</em> sp.). Cultivars with high orange-colored flesh contain much higher levels of carotenoids than less pigmented types. Sweet potato flavor is largely based on starch and sugar concentrations, and these are affected by cultivars and storage conditions.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Maturity Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Sweet potatoes are harvested when roots have reached the desirable size. Irrigation is typically stopped 2 to 3 weeks before harvest so that vines begin drying before they are removed and roots are harvested.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Good quality sweet potatoes should be smooth and firm, with uniform shape and size, be free from mechanical damage, and have a uniform peel color typical of the variety.</p>
<p>There are four U.S. Grades for sweet potato (U.S. Extra No. 1, U.S. No.1, U.S. commercial and U.S. No. 2), and grades are based on degree of freedom from defects (dirt, roots, cuts, bruises, growth cracks, decay, insects, and diseases), but also size and weight categories.</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Optimum Temperature</strong></span></p>

<p>The recommended conditions for commercial storage are to keep roots cool and dry. Sweet potato roots are chilling sensitive and should be stored between 12.5&deg;C and 15&deg;C (55&deg;F to 59&deg;F) with high relative humidity (&gt;90%). A storage life of 6-10 months can be expected under these conditions, although sprouting may begin to occur after about 6 months depending on cultivar. Temperatures above 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) lead to more rapid sprouting and weight loss. Careful handling during harvesting will minimize mechanical damage to the skin and reduce decay incidence during storage. Roots are not washed before storing in bins or crates, but only after removal for selection and packing for marketing. Sweet potato roots are commonly stored in evaporatively cooled rooms, supplemented by mechanical refrigeration late in the storage period when warm ambient temperatures occur.

<p>Sweet potato roots produce very low amounts of ethylene (~0.1 &micro;L/kg&middot;hr), although much higher rates can occur after chilling, wounding and decay development. Exposure to ethylene (1 to 10 ppm) increases respiration rates and phenolic metabolism and adversely affects flavor and color of cooked roots.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmospheres (CA)</strong></span></p>

<p>There is no commercial use of controlled atmospheres for sweet potato storage. Respiration rates of roots are reduced as oxygen is lowered from 21 to 3%. Oxygen concentrations below 3% may results in increased respiration rates due to fermentative metabolism. Response of roots to increased carbon dioxide levels is not known.</p>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Physiological and Physical Disorders </strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Chilling injury.</strong></em> Sweet potato roots are very 
sensitive to chilling injury at temperatures of 12.5&deg;C (55&deg;F) or below. Symptoms of chilling injury include fungal decay, internal pulp browning, and root shriveling. Chilled roots that have been cooked can have ""hardcore"" defect and a darker color than non-chilled roots.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders </strong></span><br /><br />Chilling and mechanical injury predispose sweet 
potatoes to decay, especially Rhizopus soft rot. Postharvest fungicides may be applied to reduce the risk of Rhizopus after handling for marketing. There are numerous other decay-causing fungi including black rot (<em>Ceratocystis</em>) and Fusarium rot. Seed piece treatment and postharvest curing are the main control measures for these organisms. In warm wet production conditions, bacterial rots can also cause postharvest losses.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations </strong></span><br /><br /><em><strong>Curing. </strong></em>The periderm of 
sweetpotato roots is easily damaged during harvest and handling, and this leads to an unsightly appearance, high rates of water loss, and increased susceptibility to decay. The process of curing the damaged skin or ""wound healing"" can be achieved by holding roots at 25-32&deg;C (77-90&deg;F) under high relative humidity (&gt;90 to 100%) for several days to 1 week. The conditions for curing sweetpotatoes are similar to those used for other tropical root and tuber crops. Growers often load bins of warm roots into storage rooms and do not turn on the fans for evaporative cooling until after about 1 week. This interval before cooling provides the warm humid conditions necessary for curing wounds.</p>

</div>","<p><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>Maturity Indices</strong></span><br /><br />The 
tomatillo or husk tomato (<em>Physalis ixocarpa</em>) is a small, spherical and green or green-purple fruit surrounded by an enlarged calyx or ""husk."" As the fruit matures, it fills the husk and can split it open by harvest. Tomatillos are the key ingredients in fresh and cooked green salsas and other Latin American dishes. The freshness and greenness of the husk is a quality criteria. Fruit should be firm, bright green as the green color and acidic flavor are the main culinary contributions of tomatillos.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span><br /><br />Tomatillos can be harvested at various stages of development. 
For commercial marketing, they should be harvested when the fruits are well formed and have substantially filled the husk but are still bright green in color. Overmature fruit are light green or yellowing and should be avoided since they are sweeter and undesirable for most uses.</p>

<p>Tomatillos can be forced-air or room cooled. The main reason to cool rapidly is to retain the fresh appearance of the husk. Tomatillos can be stored under a wide range of conditions. At ambient temperatures, the husks will dry, but the fruit will remain in good condition for about 1 week. For longer storage life temperatures of 5&deg;C to 10&deg;C (41&deg;F to 50&deg;F) with moderate humidity levels (80-90% RH) are recommended to retain the freshness of the fruit and the husk. At 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) chilling injury will occur after about 3 weeks.

<p><em><strong>Standard Tomatoes.</strong></em> Minimum harvest maturity (Mature Green 2) is defined by internal fruit structure indices. Seeds are fully developed and are not cut upon slicing the fruit. Gel formation is advanced in at least one locule and jellylike material is forming in other locules.<br /><br /><em><strong>ESL Tomatoes</strong></em>.* Off-vine ripening is severely affected if fruit are harvested at the MG2 stage. Minimum harvest maturity is better defined as equivalent to ripeness class Pink (USDA Color Stage 4 more than 30 percent but no more than 60 percent of the fruit surface, overall, shows a pink-red color.)<br /><br />*Extended Shelf-Life trait is due, in part, to either the presence of the <em>rin</em> or <em>nor</em> gene.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Quality Indices</strong></span></p>

<p>Standard tomato quality is primarily based on uniform shape and freedom from growth or handling defects. Size is not a factor of grade quality but may strongly influence commercial quality expectations.<br /><br /><em><strong>Shape.</strong></em> Well formed for type (round, globe, flattened globe, roma)</p>
<p><em><strong>Color.</strong></em> Uniform color (orange-red to deep red; light yellow). No green shoulders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Appearance.</strong></em> Smooth and small blossom-end scar and stem-end scar. Absence of growth cracks, catfacing, zippering, sunscald, insect injury, and mechanical injury or bruises.</p>
<p><em><strong>Firmness.</strong></em> Yields to firm hand pressure. Not soft and easily deformed due to an overripe condition.</p>
<p>U.S. grades are No. 1, Combination, No. 2, and No. 3. Distinction among grades is based predominantly on external appearances, bruising and firmness.<br /><br />Greenhouse grown tomatoes are graded as U.S. No. 1 or No. 2 only.</p>

Responses to Ethylene</strong></span></p>

<p>Tomatoes are sensitive to exogenous ethylene and exposure of mature-green fruit to ethylene will initiate ripening. Ripening tomatoes produce ethylene at a moderate rate and co-storage or shipment with sensitive commodities, such as lettuce and cucumbers, should be avoided.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Ripening</strong></span></p>

<p>Faster ripening results from higher temperatures between 12.5-25&deg;C (55-77&deg;F); 90-95% R.H.; 100 ppm ethylene. Good air circulation must be maintained to ensure temperature uniformity within the ripening room and to prevent the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> (above 1%) retards the action of ethylene in stimulating ripening.<br /><br />The optimum ripening temperature to ensure sensory and nutritive quality is 20&deg;C (68&deg;F). Color development is optimal and retention of vitamin C content is highest at this ripening temperature. Tomatoes allowed to ripen off-the-vine above 25&deg;C (77&deg;F) will develop a more yellow and less red color and will be softer.<br /><br />Ethylene treatment typically extends for 24-72 hours. A second treatment period may follow repacking if immature green fruit were included in the harvest.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Responses to Controlled Atmospheres (CA)</strong></span></p>

<p>Controlled atmosphere storage or shipping offer a moderate level of benefit. Low O<sub>2</sub> levels (3-5%) delay ripening and the development of surface and stem-scar molds without severely impacting sensory quality for most consumers. Storage times of up to 7 weeks have been reported for tomatoes using a combination of 4% O<sub>2</sub>, 2% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. More typically, 3% O<sub>2</sub> and 0-3% CO<sub>2</sub> are used to maintain acceptable quality for up to 6 weeks prior to ripening. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> above 3-5 % is not tolerated by most cultivars and will cause injury. Low O<sub>2 </sub>(1%) will cause off-flavors, objectionable odors, and other condition defects, such as internal browning.</p>

Symptoms of freezing injury include a watersoaked appearance, excessive softening, desiccated appearance of the locular gel.<br /><br />Tomatoes are sensitive to many production and environment-genetic interaction disorders which may be manifested during postharvest ripening or postharvest inspection. Fertilizer and irrigation management, weather conditions, insect feeding injury, asymptomatic virus infection, and unknown agents may interact to affect postharvest quality. Examples are Blossom-end Rot, Internal White Tissue, Rain Checking, Concentric and Radial Cracking, Puffiness, Persistent Green Shoulder, and Graywall. Several references with photographic keys to disorders are available.

<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Pathological Disorders</strong></span><br /><br />

Diseases are an important source of postharvest loss depending on season, region and handling practices. Commonly, decay or surface lesions result from the fungal pathogens <em>Alternaria</em> (Black Mold Rot), <em>Botrytis</em> (Gray Mold Rot), <em>Geotrichum</em> (Sour Rot), and <em>Rhizopus</em> (Hairy Rot).</p>
<p><strong><em>Bacterial Soft Rot.</em></strong> Caused by <em>Erwinia </em>spp. can be a serious problem particularly if proper harvest and packinghouse sanitation is not used. <br /><br />Treatment with hot air or hot water immersion (55&deg;C for 0.5-1.0 min.) has been effective in preventing surface mold but has not been used extensively for commercial treatments. CA can be effective in delaying fungal growth on the stem-end and fruit surface.<br /><br />Greenhouse tomatoes marketed on-the-vine (""cluster tomatoes"") are very susceptible to Botrytis Gray Mold, especially if film-wrapped in a tray.
<br /><br /><span style=""color: #663300;""><strong>
Special Considerations</strong></span><br /><br />Rapid cooling soon after harvest is essential for 
optimal postharvest keeping quality. The precooling endpoint is typically 12.5&deg;C (55&deg;F). Forced-air cooling is the most effective practice but room cooling is more common.</p>
